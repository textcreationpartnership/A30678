            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Have made bold here to preſent you with a Diſcourſe of Death, or rather with a Diſcourſe with my ſelf concerning Death. I am not ignorant that 'tis an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing Theam to declaim upon before many of the great ones of the times, who fear
<pb facs="tcp:34727:3"/>Death more than Hell it ſelf, as believing it to be a Reality; when God and Devil, Heaven and Hell, they would believe are Fictions: The apprehenſion of Death puts them into a cold ſweat; it makes them tremble, not much unlike to <hi>Belſhazzars</hi> hand-writing upon the wall;

            <p>But you may demand, why I prefix your Name to theſe unpoliſht lines?

Neither is it becauſe I think you have more need of ſuch a diſcourſe than others have, that I ſend it to you: I know you too well to have ſuch a conceit; but it is to teſtifie the great reſpect I have for you, and hereby to acknowledge thoſe debts that I cannot pay, when I am not able to give you any thing worthy your ſelf. I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly further you in your great deſign, and
<pb facs="tcp:34727:8"/>put a weapon into your hand againſt you come to fight againſt your laſt enemy, Death; and yet I ſend you this as a Tenant doth a preſent to his Landlord, not to relieve his wants, but to teſtifie his dependance, and as an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of his future ſervice. I know you need not with <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia</hi> to have a Monitor to mind you of your Mortality: I ſend it, as a bad Debtor when he cannot pay the Stock, he payes the Intereſt, or at leaſt acknowledges the debt, and begs a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er time of payment; ſo 'tis with me. Fain would I avoid the title of Ingratefull, which ſounded ſo harſhly in the ears of the Heathen, that they thought it to be the worſt of ſins; <hi>Ingratum dixeris, omnia dixeris.</hi> I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you to be well skill'd in thoſe mortifying Meditations, and as deeply learned in ſelf-reſignation of your will to Gods, as moſt are.

'Tis like enough theſe will not have time to read this, from their neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Recreation; but this is no fault of mine, 'tis doubt they will want time for other things alſo: but thoſe that will not give themſelves the trouble, 'tis doubt
<pb facs="tcp:34727:16"/>will ere long meet with trouble of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature. Others may think the Book uſeleſs, becauſe many have treated upon this Subject: To theſe I anſwer, The more ſhame they are practiſed no better. It was indeed <hi>Solons</hi> complaint, <hi>That there were many good Laws made, but one was wanting to put all the reſt in execution:</hi> So many good Rules for Life and Death are publiſhed, but could a Book be publiſhed to perſwade men to live by theſe Rules, it would be a happy work. I am not ſo vain or ſimple to think this may prove ſuch a piece, yet I know not what better Subject to treat of, that is more likely to prevail, than a Treatiſe of Death, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men to practiſe the Rules of Life: for thoſe that <hi>put far from them the evil day,</hi> are moſt like to neglect their daily Duty; and what hitherto is written, ſeems too little to effect the work, and therefore I have added my Teſtimony to the reſt. I know 'tis eaſie for <hi>Momus</hi> to quarrel and find fault with another mans Tale, when perhaps he may tell it worſe himſelf; 'tis eaſier to find fault with another, than to be free from faults himſelf: Thoſe that have done better, or will do better, I ſhall give them their due reſpect; for others, I ſhall not value their cenſure; what I have
<pb facs="tcp:34727:17"/>done hath pleaſed my ſelf, and the work was undertaken for my ſelf, and I hope I ſhall not diſpleaſe any ſober or diſcreet perſon; but for thoſe that God, his Word, his Works, or his Providences cannot pleaſe, I neither hope nor deſire to pleaſe: what I have done is intended for a Cordial for thoſe that have Death in their eyes, and the Fear of God in their hearts, and theſe uſually have better Stomachs than to nauſeate their meat, becauſe not modiſhly dreſt; thoſe I mean that have Gods beauty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpots, not the Worlds upon them; I mean Grace in the heart, not Spots on the face, to adorn them and make them lovely in the eyes of God and good men; 'tis theſe I ſpeak to: As for thoſe that take the World for their Portion, and therefore are loth to leave it, I ſhall not envy them, but pity them, their Portion is little worth; for Nobleneſs of Blood, Greatneſs of Birth, Crowns and Kingdoms, ſhine not ſo bright as the Image of God in poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> at the Gate, or <hi>Job</hi> upon the Dunghil; for Grace is better than a thouſand Eſcutche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for theſe are but empty badges of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>I have only two ſorts of perſons here to ſpeak to: The firſt are poor Deſponding Chriſtians, that though they have right to and
<pb facs="tcp:34727:17"/>Intereſt in Chriſt and Glory, yet are under ſome black and direful apprehenſions of Death; and though they would willingly live to God, and if required dye for God, yet are not out of fear of Death: To theſe I have ſpoke unto moſt in the Book, and and therefore ſhall ſay little to them in the Epiſtle: The other ſort are ſuch, that though they would dye the Death of the Righteous, and have the righteous mans reward, yet are they loth to live their-lives; they would have the wages, but none of the work; they would dye happily, but will not live holily; they would land in Heaven, but they ſail the contrary way; they will not go into the Vineyard, and yet expect their penny at night: ſuch as theſe haply are afraid of Death, and well they may, for it will <hi>ſpeak no good to them, but evil,</hi> as <hi>Ahab</hi> ſaid of <hi>Micaiah:</hi> Now I have ſaid but a little to thoſe in the Book, for it was not my buſineſs, and therefore I ſhall ſpeak the more to them in the Epiſtle; not that I have any comfort for them in this Condition, but only this, that there is a poſſibility to get out, and therefore would willingly lend them my hand to help them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut; and therefore I ſhall reach out ſome Directions, which if they take, they will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e capable of the comfort the Book it ſelf

<pb facs="tcp:34727:20"/>both to hate God, and to be hated by God; he cannot be eſpouſed to the World, but he muſt be divorced from God; ſee this in <hi>Judas,</hi> in <hi>Demas,</hi> in <hi>Demetrius,</hi> in <hi>Ahab;</hi> he will have <hi>Naboath</hi>'s Vineyard, or he will have his blood, though he loſe his Soul for it;

If the World ſeem a Pearl in his eye, he will not let it goe if he have no aſſurance of a better:
<note place="margin">Mat. 19.22</note> ſee this in the young man in the Goſpel, that would not exchange Earth for Heaven, nor the Creature for God, that parted with Chriſt whom he pretended to love, rather than with his Eſtate which he did love: Oh World! how doſt thou bewitch thy great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt admirers! how doſt thou deceive thoſe that truſt in thee!

<pb facs="tcp:34727:21"/>it proves like a buſh of Thorns, the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er we graſp it, the more deeply it wounds; and when by Experience we find, that no Content, Satisfaction or Happineſs is to be had in the enjoyment, we ſhall not much trouble at the loſs: In a word, while the World is admired, Death is hated, but when Heaven is in our eye, Death looks more lovely. If ever therefore you would dye Happily and Comfortably, beware of letting out your affections upon the World, for you will never be willing to leave what you love, nor to pay ſo dear for Chriſt and Heaven till you affect them better.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Direct.</hi> If you would dye happily, then redeeem your Time carefully, make preparation for a dying time, and take heed of loſing time, and ſpending it in vain; he that would win the Race, will ſet out with the firſt, and hold on to the laſt, and take all the advantages that are offered in the way; he that hath much work to do, and that of great concern, muſt not loſe the Morning, or if he do, muſt ply it hard the reſt of the day: You will find all your time that is allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you little enough for the work you have to do, and not an hour to ſpare to ſpend in idleneſs; for delays and Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are the two Gulphs wherein many
<pb facs="tcp:34727:22"/>Souls are drown'd: Many when they are young, depending upon and truſting to their Youth, their health and ſtrength, ſend Repentance thirty years before, and 'tis odds they never overtake it; many young men go to Hell that thought to repent when they were old, and many old men that thought they might have lived a little longer. Many are reſolved to ſpend their youthful dayes in the Devils ſervice, and then ſtop Gods mouth with the Blind and the Lame, but he ſeldom takes up with a death-bed Repentance from thoſe that purpoſely put him off to the laſt; he uſually reckons with ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penders of time for the Talents he hath lent them, and payes them off, not with a Penny but a Priſon; for he expects what he hath given us to glorifie him, ſhould be that way improved; upon this little inch of time Eternity doth depend, our Everlaſting well or ill being, and therefore 'tis too precious to be ſpent in vanity and folly; and how then dare you ſpend a day, an hour vainly in an Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe or other Vanity, and not know whether you have another hour or day to live? I have read of a Gentlewoman, that uſually ſpent her time in Cards and Dice, and other unneceſſary Recreations;
<pb facs="tcp:34727:22"/>and coming from her Sport late in the night, found her Maid reading, (for ſhe was godly,) and caſting her eye upon the Book, reproved her thus: <hi>Thou poor me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Soul, what alwayes reading, and ſpending thy time thus; wilt thou take no comfort in thy life?</hi> And ſo paſſing into her Chamber went to bed, but could not ſleep, but ſigh and groan; her Maid lying in the room with her, demanded the reaſon of it, and whether ſhe was well?
<note place="margin">Fox, <hi>Time and the End of Time,</hi> p. 70.</note> She replyed, She had read the word <hi>Eternity</hi> in her Book, which had ſo pierced her heart, that ſhe believed ſhe ſhould never ſleep more till ſhe had ſome better aſſurance of her Eternal condition: And if this word <hi>Eternity</hi> were but well conſidered, it might ſend our time-waſting Gallants trembling home from their Sports; but God hath hid theſe things from their eyes. There are more than thoſe guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though few more guilty; there is many a man that is a good Husband for the World, and careleſs in nothing but in matters relating to his Soul; he can obſerve Times and Seaſons for Plowing and Manuring of his ground, Seed-time and Harveſt ſhall not be neglected, not the meaneſt Beaſt but ſhall be heeded, his Garden, Orchard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall be fenced,

The Mariners that obſerve the Wind and Tide, yet neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the ſweet gales of the Spirit of God, when they blow upon the Soul, and would waft them Heavenward, and help them forward to their Journeys end, to the deſired Port. The Devil by his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence condemns us, for where his work is,

The heart of man is a Mill that will be alwayes grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if not Gods Wheat, then the Devils Tares: If the Devil ſpend all his time to deceive us, we ſhould ſpend all our time to prevent him: All the time we have is little enough, and there is none to ſpare, and
<pb facs="tcp:34727:23"/>what is paſt is irrecoverably gone, though we could give a world of Treaſure for an inch of time: Now if you would redeem time, beware of thoſe great devourers of Time, which uſually ſteal away a great part, ſuch as vain and idle Thoughts; how much of our time is this way conſumed! many an hour which might have been better ſpent, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Contemplation of God, of Chriſt, of Heaven, of Glory, is ſpent in roving vain imaginations, which bring no profit, do no good, and tend to no benefit. Yea, worldly thoughts and cares take up alſo a great part of our time; 'tis true, the World muſt have ſome of our thoughts and time, but moſt men make a bad diviſion between God and it, they let the World run away with his part as well as their own; yea much of that Sacred time ſet a part for a better uſe; yea many times amidſt our Religious duties the heart is ſtole away by the World; Idleneſs alſo conſumes much, many enter not into the Vineyard till the eleventh hour, and then mind not their work, but their Wages; vain and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Diſcourſe alſo is a Thief, and ſteals away much of our time, and many idle and unneceſſary Viſits alſo; and when all this is deducted, 'tis no wonder there is
<pb facs="tcp:34727:24"/>but little left for our grand buſineſs: to theſe may be added, immoderate lying in Bed, vain and time ſpending Dreſſings and Attirings, the whole Mornings work to our Female Gallants; immoderate and unneceſſary Recreations, which ſome make all the Calling they follow, Drinking, Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and what not? but if theſe, in this their idle expence of time, ſhould ask themſelves this queſtion, Which of the Eternities lye before them? and to which of them they are going? it might ſpoil their ſport; for when Death hath ſtruck his ſtroak, the Soul is in a ſtated condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which Eternity it ſelf cannot alter; and ſeriouſly, 'tis one of the ſaddeſt ſights in the World, to a man apprehenſive of the danger, to ſee an unconverted man fetch his laſt breath, and lanching forth into an infinite Ocean of boiling Lead and burning Brimſtone; for the avoiding of that, <hi>take time while time ſerves,</hi> and loſe not that Prodigally that cannot be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the whole World.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>Direction.</hi> The next thing I would adviſe you to, which indeed is the chief of all, is to get an Intereſt in Chriſt, that ſo you may have a title to Glory; for till this be had, you cannot dye ſafely, and till it be cleared up, you cannot dye comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably;
<pb facs="tcp:34727:24"/>for who would leave a preſent Poſſeſſion, that hath no aſſurance of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? and when this is done, Death will not be terrible. But what can bear up the Soul againſt the pangs of Death, if this be wanting? Now the way to get an Intereſt in Chriſt, is to eſpouſe the Soul to him; now there is nothing but Ignorance can ſtave off our affections from him: <hi>ignotus nulla cupido;</hi> The blind World can ſee no Excellency in him, no need of him, nor any uſe of him, and therefore they have no love nor deſire for him: but all that know him, will love him; who prizeth a Phyſician that is not convinc'd of his skill, and finds he hath a real need of him? for who will take Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick before he be ſick? or minds a Plaiſter before he have a Sore? But when the poor ſoul is convinced of her undone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by Nature, and that there is nothing in her, or that can be done by her, will ſerve turn for Salvation; yea, that help is not to be had in any Creature, no not in the Angels themſelves could ſhe be Eſpouſed to them; for they cannot pay her debts, nor ſecure the Soul; in this deſparing condition, no wonder the Soul dreads death; but when it knows withall, that though there be an Emptineſs
<pb facs="tcp:34727:25"/>in the Creature, there is a Fulneſs in Chriſt, and that he is fully able to make her eternally happy; and that Chriſt doth make love to her, and ſends many Suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors in his behalf, to woe for her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and that he is the only ſuitable object in the world for her Affections, and that he can make her happy, when all the reſt would leave her miſerable: I ſay under theſe convictions ſhe begins to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to Chriſts propoſals, when ſhe ſees he is more uſeful than any other, and will ſtand her in more ſtead both in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and Adverſity, in Health, Sickneſs, in Life and at Death, when all other helps fail her: While the world is lookt upon to be the beſt match, Chriſt will not be valued, till the cheat be found out; for who will forſake the better to chooſe the worſe? but when they ſee Chriſt really better than the world, they will then part with the world for him; for who will ſtick at ſuch a bargain, when a man conſiders that the world can do him no good at Death or Judgment; <hi>But Godlineſs hath the promiſe of this life,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Iſa. 63.9.</note> and he makes over all his riches to her, his Merits, his Righteouſneſs, his Spirit, his Graces, and his Glory;
<note place="margin">Plal. 34.10.</note> he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſhe <hi>ſhall want nothing that is good, and that he will never leave her nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake her,</hi>

               <hi>and that all things ſhall work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for her good:</hi> Now whatever he hath promiſed, he can make it good; for he is both Omnipotent, and Omniſcient, and he will make it good, for he is Faithfull, and the Experience of five thouſand years prove it, in all which time no man could ſtand forth and ſay, This Promiſe God hath failed in; the world yields us ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle comfort if God give it a Commiſſion; but Chriſt <hi>is all and in all;</hi> all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency that is in the Creature, is but as a Vein to lead us to this Mine, as a drop of this Ocean, and as a ray of this Sun; whatever our condition be, he can help us; if the Soul be ſick, he is her Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, and all others are Phyſicians of no value; if wounded, he hath a Plaiſter of
<pb facs="tcp:34727:26"/>his own Blood to cure her; if ſhe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, here is food, the Bread of life, and the Water of life; <hi>his fleſh is meat indeed, and his blood drink indeed;</hi> If ſhe be <hi>Poor, and Blind, and Miſerable, and Naked,</hi> he can make ſupplies; here is a Treaſure to enrich her, a Pearl of great price, and ſpiritual Eye-ſalve to make her ſee; if ſhe have Enemies he is her Champion, that can overcome the Devil and all his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and none can hurt her but through his ſides: In a word, ſhe can want nothing when her Lord and Husband poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes all things; the <hi>Cattle of a thouſand hills are his, yea all the beaſts of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt;</hi> with his own Robes he arrayes her, and with the Jewels of his Grace he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorns her, with his Spirit he directs her; and if heavy laden, bears her burden; if ſhe be weary, he is her reſting place, and hath promiſed <hi>never to leave her nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake her;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13.5.</note> and then no matter what others do: Theſe promiſes the Soul may preſs home by Prayer, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did in a great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
<note place="margin">Gen. 32.9.</note> 
               <hi>Lord, thou ſaidſt thou wouldſt do me good;</hi> and this was as good as preſent pay, for God loves to be bound by his word, and to be ſued upon his own bond: Prayer is a putting the Promiſes in Suit; God can no more deny ſuch Prayers,
<pb facs="tcp:34727:26"/>than he can deny himſelf: what need the Soul to fear when Gods Word is out upon it, <hi>That all things ſhall work together for her good?</hi> and if all things, then Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nay Sin it ſelf:

Now look over all the World, and ſee if you can find ſuch a match for the Soul, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Creature in Heaven or Earth hath deſerved thy Affections better than he, or hath done more, or will do more than Jeſus Chriſt; that is a greater Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor than he, and hath beſtowed better Gifts; whether any other can pay thy Debts, or make preparation for the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal well-being of the Soul; and if he prove the fitteſt Match, ſtand not upon Terms with him, think not to alter his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or make him abate of his Price; he expects neither Money nor Moneys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth;

We are in a race, and run for our lives, and ſhall we not ſet out with the firſt, and hold on to the laſt, and uſe our utmoſt diligence in the way? if we turn aſide, or turn back, or ſlack our pace, or ſit down, we are never like to win the prize; we ſtake our Souls to Heaven, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis for no ſmall wager; if we run well, heaven is ours; if not, the Soul our chiefeſt Jewel is loſt; we have a great deal of work to do, and Night draws on; <hi>and the ſhadows of the Evening are ſtretched out,</hi> and <hi>when night comes no man can work;</hi> and is it not time to be up and doing? moſt men are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildred in the dark, and loſe themſelves with their reward, and miſs their way, or fall ſhort of their deſired Journeys end, and this will be our caſe if we prevent it not; for the way is difficult, and delayes as well as miſtakes are dangerous. Many that have wit enough to get an Eſtate, yea to deceive and to circumvent their Brethren, have yet been deceived themſelves in this their great concern; yea many that have made a great profeſſion of Religion, and have directed others, and have been their guides, for want of a guide have miſcarried
<pb facs="tcp:34727:33"/>themſelves, and loſt their way: thoſe that have lived under the powerful means of Grace, and performed many duties, and preacht and prayed, and thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wiſer than others, and caſt their ground, and thought to go a nearer way to Heaven than others, yet have been loſt, and never came to the place they aimed at. Thoſe that have exhorted others to take heed, have loſt themſelves for want of heed; and though they have been confident in the way, have yet miſs'd of the way; and is it time for us that never arriv'd to that heighth to ſit ſtill and venture: there is but a little between us and death, and if death cut the thred of our lives before our peace be made with God, we are paſt remedy; for if once we fall into that gulph of Eternity, there is no getting out, we ſhall never find bank nor bottom: <hi>As the tree falls ſo it lyes,</hi> all the world cannot turn it; and if the Soul miſcarry, our caſe will be worſe than the beaſt that periſheth; for as now men are never weary of ſinning, then God will be never weary of puniſhing, and all the racks, tortures and torments in the world will not equalize the torments of a miſcarrying Soul: but if we are prepared for death, have made our peace with God, and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Accounts with him, have eſpouſed
<pb facs="tcp:34727:33"/>the Soul to Chriſt, and cleared up our Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences for Heaven, 'tis not the Devil, nor his Inſtruments, 'tis not death, <hi>nor him that hath the power of death,</hi> nay 'tis not Hell it ſelf that can hinder a Believers happineſs: for Aſſurance of Gods love will bear up the heart above water, and keep it from deſponding or ſinking even under the pangs of death.

The more of the heart is in the ſin, the greater is the aggravation, but the more of the heart is in a duty, the better God accepts it. Where the heart goes not along with the ſin, God will pardon it, but if the heart go not along with the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he will not own it: weak performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are accepted where the heart is right, glorious actions are abominable
<pb facs="tcp:34727:36"/>where the heart is rotten. Now the heart by nature is polluted, and muſt be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; it is deceitful, and if not lookt to will betray us; and when the heart is polluted the whole man is defiled, and till this be cleanſed a man is neither fit to live, nor fit to dye, nor after death to come to Judgment.

<pb facs="tcp:34727:37"/>the Angels will carry the Soul into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> boſom, yea lodge it in the Arms of their dear Redeemer. Theſe apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions made <hi>Paul to deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Martyrs</hi> to be ſo willing to dye, and ſo chearfully to go to the ſtake: Love to God alſo is another grace which much ſweetens the very thoughts of death; indeed this ſweetens the ſharpeſt paſſage of Providence, when we think, this is my Fathers will, whom I love, and who loves me, and knows beſt what is for my good; yea death it ſelf ſhall be welcome when 'tis a Meſſenger from him I love, to fetch me home to his boſom: what will not a loving Wife ſuffer to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy her beloved Husband? love deſires the ſtricteſt union, and moſt intimate communion with the party beloved, but this the Soul cannot obtain but by Death: O ſaith the Soul, now I lye under the hatches, troubled with a thouſand infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, I can ſeldom have a glimpſe of Chriſt here; well, the time is at hand that I ſhall ſee him face to face, and enjoy him in glory, where I ſhall ſerve him without diſtraction, and never be troubled more with vain thoughts or roving imaginations, or any of Satans temptations: Oh when will this time be! The other graces of

Now the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are made to theſe graces not only of this life but of that to come; among the reſt of the good things promiſed, is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Happineſs, but what is a carnal man the better for theſe promiſes, that is not qualified for them? but when by Faith we can ſee this Crown of glory, and ſee our Names written upon it, and get a <hi>Piſgah</hi>-ſight of this heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> we ſhall willingly venture over this <hi>Jordan,</hi> and encounter all the Sons of <hi>Anak</hi> we meet in our way, and not fear what Man, what Devils, what Death can do unto us: get theſe Graces in exerciſe, and you need not fear Fire and Faggot.</p>

Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove therefore all the means which God hath afforded you for this end; for thoſe that refuſe the means ſeldom attain the end.
<pb facs="tcp:34727:38"/>Improve his Word and Ordinances; theſe are the appointed means, however ſome ſcorn at them, and ſome think they are above them, but thoſe that go not this way ſeldom come to Heaven. In the Word are given Rules how to live, and how to dye, and how to behave ourſelves in all Conditions; here is Oyl to be had, and thoſe that neglect will be to ſeek when the Bridegroom comes. Thoſe that now neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Wedding-garment, will want it when they have occaſion to uſe it, and ſo be thruſt out of the Bride-chamber. This Word of God ſhould be our daily ſtudy, for here are directions both for life and death, and none but thoſe that are bad Husbands for the ſoul, will neglect it: here are the precious Promiſes which are our Fathers Legacy, out of which the Soul by Faith ſucks ſweetneſs, which are ſpecial Cordials againſt fainting fits, which bear up the head above water, and the heart in all ſtorms and tempeſts: here is directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Heavens way, yea way-marks ſet up that we ſhould not erre nor wander; here you may find what qualifications God requires in his ſervants, and what Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for Heaven are good and authentick, and what God will own another day; and if by the help of the Spirit you can read
<pb facs="tcp:34727:39"/>them in your own hearts, as in a counter pane, there is no better Evidence for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, no greater Cordial in the world to bear up the heart: here you may find com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and conſolatious in all your condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and if you walk in this road you will meet with much help and aſſiſtance, yea many companions in your Journey: here you have the Spirit of God both to direct and comfort you, and who can erre that hath ſuch a guide, or droop that hath ſuch a comforter? <hi>here you ſhall hear a voice behind you ſaying, this is the way walk in it, turn not to the right hand or to the left:</hi> here you have the aſſiſtance of Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to direct you, but take heed of quenching the motions of his Spirit, or abuſing his Meſſengers, leſt his Spirit leave ſtriving with you, and God take away his Meſſengers in his anger: here you may find many that have walked the ſame way, met with the ſame troubles, ſuffered the ſame afflictions, temptations, croſſes and loſſes as you do, and yet have born it with patience, and overcome it with conſtancy and comfort; here you may know the worſt that death can do to you is for your advantage, if you love God, for ſuch death cannot hurt; kill you it may, hurt you it cannot; the worſt it can do is but
<pb facs="tcp:34727:39"/>to ſend you to your Fathers houſe the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Meditate therefore upon this Word of God, and alſo upon the Attributes of God, and this muſt needs ſupport you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſufferings. Meditate alſo upon mans Mortality to quicken you in your pace, of the Worlds vanity and emptineſs to make you ſlight it, and the fulneſs of Chriſt to make you to deſire him. The Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of death will not make you dye ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but ſafer, and the Promiſes will yield ſweetneſs even in the pangs of death; for death is to the godly but as a Purſivant to fetch them to Heaven, and his wiſdom, power, holineſs, juſtice, goodneſs, and truth, are Cordials alſo, and will help to keep the heart from fainting and deſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and will ſhield the Spirits againſt all croſſes and afflictions they ſhall meet with: and by Meditation in the Word, you may learn the happineſs of the godly, and the miſeries of the wicked, and what will be the end of both; yea you may find there what are the pains of Hell, and the Joyes of Heaven, and theſe may be uſed as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to a holy life: Prayer alſo is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent duty to prepare for death; by this God is engaged to help at a time of need: Chriſtian Conference alſo is another help, wherein one fire-ſtick helps to inkindle ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="tcp:34727:40"/>till all come into a flame. Now thoſe that are conſtant and faithful in theſe and the reſt of the Ordinances and means God hath appointed to this end, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyeſt to have the qualifications before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and thoſe thus qualified need not fear death; thoſe that walk evenly with God in Proſperity, are moſt like to hold out in Adverſity,
<note place="margin">Heb. 2.14.</note> and need not fear death, <hi>nor him that hath the power of death, the Devil.</hi> The more faithful and conſtant any one is in the Trade of Godlineſs, the more Aſſurance he may have of a happy death, and joyful Reſurrection; and what hinders then but a chearful reſigning our ſelves to death when God calls? a man will not willingly reſign up his old Leaſe till he have aſſurance of a better: but who will not leave a Cottage for a Palace, or exchange an old Suit for a new, Rags for Robes? when aſſurance of Heaven is got, no wonder if earth be contemned; for who will not change a Temporal Life for Life Eternal?</p>
            <p>And thus, <hi>(Courteous Reader)</hi> if thou art prepared, I have ſpoken to thee in the Book, if not in the Epiſtle, wherein I have given thee ſome direction how thou maiſt be prepared, and how thou maiſt come to be fit to live, and fit to dye, and fit to lye
<pb facs="tcp:34727:40"/>in the Arms of Chriſt for ever: What effect the Book will have upon the one, or the Directions on the other, I know not; but my deſire is, and my Prayer ſhall be, that it may be beneficial both to the one, and to the other: This will be your own advantage, but the comfort of him who ſubſcribes himſelf.</p>

<note place="margin">Heb. 9.27.</note> there is a Decree paſs'd in Heaven, which cannot be rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, more firm than the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians;</hi> and wilt thou loſe thy God, thy Chriſt, thy Soul, thy Heaven, and Happineſs, and all to prolong thy life a little longer, which yet thou knoweſt not whether thou canſt do it or not? If thou dye for Chriſt, thou putteſt off thy life at the greateſt advantage imaginable; and if thou refuſe when he requires it, thou run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt thy ſelf upon the moſt deſperate dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger conceivable. Thou think'ſt perhaps the condition is hard, and ſo it is if thou only conſult Fleſh and Blood, and the Senſitive

'Tis thy duty 'tis true to part with any earthly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments for lifes ſake;
<note place="margin">Job 2.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Skin for skin and all that a man hath will he give for his life;</hi> but Life and all muſt go, to ſecure the Soul: Death 'tis true is an enemy to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet in ſome caſes it muſt be choſen, and we muſt deny our ſelves: Hunger and Thirſt are natural to us, and the Appetite requires Meat and Drink, and yet did we know there was Poyſon put into our Cup or Diſh, reaſon would reſtrain the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34727:46"/>and rather chooſe Hunger or Thirſt than a worſer evil. Phyſick is not pleaſing, neither to be choſen for its own ſake; yet for healths ſake we take bitter Pills, and unſavoury potions. Pain is not pleaſant to the fleſh, but an enemy to Senſe, yet Reaſon perſwades us ſometimes to open a Vein, to prevent greater pain, and to cut off a Joynt, a Member, a Limb, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent greater miſchief. Some diſcontented perſons weary of a miſerable life, not only wiſh for death, but lay violent hands upon themſelves, chooſing Death as the leſſer evil; theſe leap out of the Frying-pan in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire, and conſider not what the Event of ſuch a death is; theſe have low ends, and drive on a bad bargain, and ſeeking to avoid <hi>Scylla</hi> they fall into <hi>Charyb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 3.21, 22.</note> theſe obey not Gods Call but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Whiſtle. There are ſome <hi>that long for death but it cometh not, and dig for it more than for hid treaſure; they rejoyce exceedingly and are glad when they can find the grave:</hi> This is unnatural joy, for as 'tis our duty to yield up our breath when he that gave it calls for it, ſo 'tis our duty to preſerve our Lives, and our ſin to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten our death before he requires it: We muſt not leave our ſtation till our Captain commands it; we muſt not leave the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34727:46"/>when we would, but when our work is done, and with our Maſter's leave: We muſt not with our own hands pluck down theſe earthly Tabernacles, neither deny our conſent when God will pluck them down; we are Tenants at will, and muſt not think to have our Houſes at our own diſpoſe, whether they ſhall down or not: we came not into the world but at his appointment, and muſt not go out without his leave. I know, a Godly man though he have ſome aſſurance of a better habitation, is not ſo reconciled to death as to chooſe it for its own ſake, for Deaths looks are not lovely, it being <hi>the King of terrors,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 18.19.</note> and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of Kings, and in it ſelf formidable, and hath daunted the courage of the ſtouteſt Souldiers, and triumphs over the moſt triumphant Conquerour, and ſometimes diſcompoſeth the moſt compoſed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. And therefore as on the one hand it ſhould not be overmuch feared, ſo on the other it ſhould not be overmuch ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Chriſt himſelf had ſome fearfull ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of it, and well he might, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he had to ſuffer; the Sting was then in, but by his death it was taken out in reference to Believers; yet the Serpent is formidable, but not poyſonful; it will ſtrike ſtill, though it cannot ſting: and as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34727:47"/>'tis an Outlet to Life, ſo 'tis an Inlet to Eternity, and who can enter into ſo vaſt a Gulph and ſo boundleſs an Ocean without amazement, where he can find neither bank nor bottom? 'Tis impoſſible for men to put off Humanity, neither doth Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity teach us to be Stoicks, yet it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to bound and moderate our paſſions, and not overmuch to fear Death. When we have a lawful call to it, and when 'tis our duty to dye; when God ſends, let who will be the Meſſenger, obey we muſt.

                  <hi>Fear not them</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that can kill the body, and can do no more, but fear him that can caſt both Soul and Body into Hell, yea I ſay unto you fear him.</hi> All outward things muſt be undervalued for Life ſake, but Life it ſelf muſt go for Gods ſake: if thou ſell thy life for any worldly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, thou wilt make a hard bargain.

<note place="margin">Luk. 12.20</note>

<note place="margin">Mat. 16.26.</note> 
                  <hi>for what ſhall it profit a man to gain the whole world and loſe his own ſoul? or what

'Tis not a chooſing death thou art Preſs'd to, but a ſubmiſſion to the will of God that is required at thy hands; and of two evils the leaſt is to be choſen: if thou muſt either chooſe death, or chooſe ſin, death is the more eligible; for ſin will expoſe thee to the ſecond death, and prove the everlaſting ſeparation of ſoul and body from God, which is worſe a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times than death. If thou muſt loſe thy life or thy ſoul, let life go; if thou muſt deny life, or deny Chriſt, Chriſt is better than thy life, being the very life of thy ſoul; and he that to avoid a little tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral pain, incurs eternal torments, makes a fooliſh bargain. Now though there be no reaſon to love death, yet is there great reaſon why thou ſhouldſt love God bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than life;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 63.3.</note> 
                  <hi>whoſe loving kindneſs is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than life:</hi> though life be dear, yet Chriſt is dearer. The Cup of death may be bitter, but Hell and Damnation, and the eternal Wrath of God are much bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, which if thou forſake Chriſt thou muſt drink up to the bottom, which Eternity will be little enough to do: God puts Sugar into the former, none into the

Then will a difference be made between the Good and the Bad, as wide as between Heaven and Hell. Death is a debt we owe to nature, and pay it we muſt, and tis not much matter whether it be ſooner or later, or whether we dye a natural or violent Death; they both ſignifie the ſame thing; ſhould'ſt thou turn every ſtone, and uſe all means direct or indirect, thou canſt not long preſerve thy life: poſſibly if thou deny payment of this debt, when God requires it, thou maiſt preſerve it a little longer, and but a little; for God will ere long diſtrain for the Debt, and then caſt thee into an Eternal Priſon. Gods determinate counſel is upon thee, and he knows eventually when thy
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34727:52"/>death ſhall be: <hi>he hath determined thy bounds that thou canſt not paſs;</hi> God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Abraham</hi> to Sacrifice his Son, and it was his Duty ſo to do, and his ſin if he refuſed, though God determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned eventually it ſhould not be done, yet if he had refuſed it he had miſs'd of the Bleſſing. Thy appointed time is with God, but unknown to thee; 'tis his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will that is thy duty, thou muſt look after, not eventually what ſhall come to paſs; <hi>ſecret things belong to God,</hi>

                  <hi>but things revealed unto us:</hi> if God and his truth, his Goſpel and his cauſe call thee to lay down thy life, and ſeal thy doctrine with thy blood, thou muſt carry thy life in thy hand, and lay it down at his feet: If God command thee to loſe thy life, 'tis thy duty to dye, and if by denying Chriſt life be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, 'tis a hard bargain, and 'tis no leſs thy ſin though God eventually deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined thy life to be prolonged. There are many that haſten their death by their intemperance, and ſacrifice their lives to <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> to drunkenneſs and luſt, and ſo become a Victim to the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; yet are not Gods decrees altered; for though many haſten their death, or uſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful means to preſerve their lives, and ſo both the one and the other become Guilty,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34727:53"/>yet Gods decrees are not altered. If thou devote thy life to God, and fully reſolveſt to loſe it for his ſake, if he require it, though he never call thee forth to ſuffer, thou wilt not loſe thy reward; and if thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveſt thou wilt part with Chriſt, and kick up thy profeſſion rather than ſuffer for him, if he never put thee upon the trial, God will take the will for the deed; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou wilt or no, dye thou muſt, for death will not be bribed: Crowns and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms will not prolong their owners lives; thou maiſt ſay of death as <hi>Paul</hi> of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>A neceſſity is laid upon me,</hi> will I, nill I, dye I muſt: if willing, I have a reward; if againſt my will, I cannot help it; death will not be corrupted with bribes, won with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, nor terrified with threats. When the time will be, 'tis not ſo much thy concern to know, as thy duty to prepare for it: thou maiſt loſe thy ſelf, but canſt not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thy life one day beyond the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time: if thou deny God a temporal life, he will deny thee eternal life. I have read of one in perſecuting times, being called to ſuffer for the truth he had profeſſed, cryes out, <hi>The fire is hot I cannot burn;</hi> but within a ſhort ſpace he was burnt in his own houſe, and we have cauſe to fear he finds the fire of Hell incomparably hotter than the flames
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34727:53"/>he was burnt in, which yet he could not evade. Death triumphs over all ranks and Eſtates of men, from the King upon his Throne to his meaneſt Subject. <hi>Mors pauperum tabernas regumque turres aequo pulſat pede.</hi> Death makes no difference; ere long the grizly hand of Death will with a winding ſheet cover thoſe naked Breaſts and ſpotted Faces, which have been the Looking-glaſſes of luſt; And worms will ere long make their neſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe Breaſts which are now expoſed to ſight. and ſale, and eat out thoſe wanton windows of love, and meſſengers of luſt; death will then cool the courage of the ſtouteſt hot-ſpur.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34727:54"/>thee, will exchange it for life Eternal: for a Believer to dye is but as the putting off an old ſuit of cloaths,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.6.</note> and exchanging it for a new: and who will fear to put off his old naſty Rags at night for rich Robes in the morning? 'Tis but to change a Cottage for a Palace, Earth for Heaven, and the creatures for God; and who will not be willing of ſuch a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? yea of a Peaſant to be made a Prince? Whatever thou loſeſt for Chriſt, thou ſhalt loſe nothing by him; for he will repay thee a hundred fold:
<note place="margin">Mat. 19.29</note> This is the way to ſecure thy life, or to part with it at the beſt advantage, when otherwiſe thou wilt loſe thy life as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did their duties, for nothing; they prayed, they faſted, they gave alms, but by reflecting upon themſelves, and not looking at God in what they did, they loſt their Reward. If thou loſe thy life and canſt not help it, what praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy thing doſt thou? Thouſands of men, it may be imagined, that never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a life for Chriſt, have yet with others been bloodily Maſſacred upon a religious account, when ſomething elſe lay at the bottom; theſe have ſuffered Death without a reward, and this may well be thy condition. 'Tis true thou
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34727:55"/>ſhouldſt not run before thou art ſent, or expoſe thy life to danger without a call, ſo maiſt thou be guilty of thine own death, which is murder in the higheſt degree; this is the way to ſhorten thy life, but to haſten thy miſery: But to dye for Chriſt is gain, and ſoul-advantage; and how canſt thou that pretendeſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a Reſurrection to Eternal Life, and pretendeſt an intereſt in it, yet fear to dye, which is the only way to enjoy it: we ſow our ſeed willingly in hope of a plentiful crop, we go to bed willingly in hope of reſt and ſleep, and ſhall we fear to repoſe our body in the Grave in hope of a joyful Reſurrection? O the Ignorance, the Infidelity, the want of Love that appears in thee! for didſt thou really believe what thou pretendeſt to believe, or hadſt thou that love for Chriſt which thou pretendeſt to have, thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt long for the time when thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enjoy this happineſs, when thou ſhouldſt enjoy this God:

<note place="margin">Dan. 12.3.

The queſtion is not, Whether thou muſt dye or no, this is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by an irrevocable decree, but it is about the Time and the Manner of thy death: who is fitteſt to diſpoſe of it, thee or the great God that gave it? wouldſt thou have it at thine own will? alas! thou canſt not preſerve it a moment, and thou canſt not preſerve it from a violent death, and a languiſhing diſeaſe may haply be more painful than the death thy enemy puts thee to: thou canſt not deny Chriſt thy life without hazard of eternal death, and wilt thou not rather ſuffer a few pangs than run this hazard, and be obnoxious to eternal torments? Thou haſt a ſickly weakly body, many diſtempers hang upon thee, from

                  <hi>even the Devil; to deliver them which through the fear of death were all their life time ſubject to bondage:</hi> Now the only way to be delivered from this fear, is to fall under this Stroak; for death frees us from this as well as from all other miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. If thou ſhouldſt yet deny thy life, and ſo think to ſave it, thou art much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, when God is thine enemy, and thine enemy then he will be.

God needs not muſter any great Army to deſtroy thee; the leaſt of his creatures can do it, if he give them a commiſſion; and if thou deny thy life when he requires it, well maiſt thou fear this commiſſion will be ſealed; well maiſt thou fear the bread thou eateſt will choak thee, the drink thou drinkeſt will be thy bane; and what ever judgment thou ever readeſt or heard'ſt of, that ever befell. a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſinner, it may be thy portion; that the flouds may drown thee, as it did the old world, and <hi>Paraoh</hi> and his hoſt; that the fire may burn thee, as it did <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah;</hi> that the earth may open her mouth and ſwallow thee up, as it did <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram.</hi> Or whatſoever other judgments have befaln the Enemies of God, may be thy porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34727:57"/>for Apoſtacy is a moſt dangerous ſin, ſome creature or other may well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain of thee in Gods name, when thou denyeſt the debt.

God loves a chearful giver, he loves a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will Offering, and loves not grumbling Servants: millions of the Saints are now in Heaven that have travailed this road, yet none of them repent they came there too ſoon: Many of them have been taken out of the world by the hand of violence, and now have the crown of Martyrdome upon their heads;

Doſt not remember a hundred thouſand ſlain in <hi>London</hi> in one year? two or three hundred thouſand in <hi>Ireland</hi> in a few weeks bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Maſſacred? haſt thou not many Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of mortality read to thee, many Monitors of mortality within thee? doth not the dimneſs of thy eyes mind thee, the very Spectacles thou lookeſt through tell thee of the decayes in Nature; and canſt expect greater warning? or haſt any more conſiderable work to do than to provide for death? and is death yet a ſtranger? haſt thou not viſited many a ſick bed, and been with many a departing ſoul, and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their laſt breath into thy boſom, and yet haſt not ſufficient warning? God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ingaged to give thee ſo much; thou art his liſted ſouldier, and haſt taken preſs-money, and thou art ingaged to be in a continual readineſs; yet God hath given thee many a particular warning to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for death: thou haſt many a time look't death in the face, and God hath often pluckt thee by the ſhoulders, and ſhewed thee grim death before thee; and thou haſt ſeveral times received the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death within thee, and God hath in effect ſaid to thee, <hi>Set thy houſe in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for thou muſt dye;</hi> nay not only ſo, but
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:34727:59"/>God hath imployed thee to warn others, yet he hath forborn thee above ſixty years, and every year given thee many warnings, and what wouldſt thou have more? and yet art unacquainted with thy main work? What if he had taken thee hence thirty or forty years ago, as he did many that were companions with thee in vanity, what had been thy condition, that yet pretendeſt thou art not ready? and what hopes is there of thee, if God ſpare thee another year, that thou wilt bring forth better fruit? is old age the beſt and fitteſt for repentance, and preparation to dye? when thou wilt find enough to do to wraſtle with pains and bodily diſtempers? would a Captain take it for a ſufficient excuſe, if a Souldier that is by ingagement to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at an hours warning, and ſhould give him a week, a month, a years time to make ready, and at the end of that time he ſhould plead, his Arms are not fixed, nor other neceſſaries provided; and if the Captain give him another year, and at the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he ſhould plead the ſame excuſe, would this be taken for a good excuſe? yet this excuſe hath been in thy mouth many years together, and 'tis doubt if God yet leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then thy daies and give thee more years, it will be the ſame. Hath not death entred
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34727:60"/>into thy habitation? hath it not taken away thy parents, thy loving wife, thy dear children, and other of thy near relations? and didſt not yet lay it to heart? waſt thou no wiſer than fatted beaſts, that are taken away one after another to the Shambles, and thoſe that remain are ſenſeleſs of the danger, neither conſider their turn is coming? yea hath not death thrown many a dart at thee, and ſometimes wounded thee in the head, ſometimes in thy bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, and yet doſt not conſider that he hath a dart will reach thy heart? Yea ſometimes thou haſt thought thou haſt had thy deaths wound, and yet wilt take no warning to get on thy Armour? doth not the pains, the aches, the diſtempers of thy body, under which thou daily groaneſt, bid thee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for thy winding-ſheet? doth not news ring dayly in thy ear, this and that friend, relation, or neighbour is dead, and ere long others will ſay of thee, he is dead alſo? haſt thou not interred many a dead corpſe, and preacht may a Funeral Sermon, and given many an exhortation to the living to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for death, and comforted many that have loſt their friends by death, and waſt never yet ſatisfied that thou waſt mortal, and muſt dye alſo? didſt thou think thy ſelf only exempted from the common lot
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34727:60"/>of all men; or that God would bring thee to Heaven another way? or couldſt thou wiſh thou wert immortal and ſhouldſt live on earth to Eternity? art thou willing to take the Earth for Heaven, and the creature for God, and the happineſs thou meetſt with here for Heavens glory? haſt enough to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy thee here below, and deſireſt no more? if not, why wouldſt not dye and come to happineſs? if the earth be more deſireable to thee one year, why not twenty, and why not to eternity? if God ſhould bid thee chooſe thy time, and appoint it thy ſelf, what time wouldſt thou require? haply <hi>Methuſalems</hi> daies; well, but theſe would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and death at the end would be as bitter as now it is. If death were the road to Hell as 'tis to the wicked, thou mighteſt well ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle at it: And I have wondred at thoſe of them that have been ſo prodigal of their lives, when Life is the only preſervative out of Hell. Or if thy caſe were that of the beaſts, and thou were to be reduced unto the horrid eſtate of nothing, death might make thee ſhrug, but when thou believeſt that death to thee will be an entrance into glory, an outlet to miſery, and an inlet to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the ſame road that Chriſt and all the glorified Saints have gone to Heaven in, how can this be reconciled with thy
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:34727:61"/>fears? Haſt thou had ſo many diſcourſes of death, and with death, and doſt believe that the ſting is taken out by Chriſt, and doſt yet run from this Serpent, and take him for an enemy that is but thy Fathers Meſſenger, ſent for thy good? This muſt needs be thy ſin, and thy folly, and doth too evidently beſpeak thy Infidelity, or the weakneſs of thy Faith. Thou haſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted others at the laſt gaſp, and prayed with them; and for them, thou haſt ſtrengthened the weak hands, and feeble knees, and now doſt faint under the ſame burden? But hadſt thou had more mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Meditations of death, and with the Apoſtle hadſt learned <hi>to dye daily,</hi> death would not have been ſo terrible a Bugbear to thee as now it ſeems: didſt thou once a day look him in the face, by a ſerious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and by a believing expectation, he would not look ſo grim and terrible. <hi>Bears</hi> and <hi>Tigers</hi> are not ſo terrible to thoſe that are their keepers, and acquainted with them, as to others. The <hi>Lion</hi> in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was at firſt ſight a terror to the Fox, but time much allayed his fear: the more thou beholdeſt death, the leſs deformed, yea the more lovely he doth appear: death will be no excepter of perſons; the rich and poor, high and low, whether they will
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:34727:61"/>or no muſt dance in this Ring; when God commands, he muſt and will ſtrike: death is written upon thy cradle, and thou waſt rockt upon the mouth of the grave, and ever ſince no day hath been ſure to thee, but it might have been thy dying day: 'tis not long ſince thou didſt bewail the death of thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and 'tis not long before thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren will bewail thine; one <hi>generation comes and another goes,</hi> and the latter treads out the ſteps of the former: we trod out the ſteps of our predeceſſors, and our poſterity will do as much for us. The world is but a Tent to abide in for a time, an Inne to tarry in a night, a Lodging place for a way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring man, a baiting-place in a Journey: Oh the folly of moſt men, that take it for their Inheritance, and look for no more; but to the Godly 'tis no continuing city, no abiding place, neither indeed worthy our love. Were the world as the garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> full of delights and pleaſures, thou hadſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay for it, and yet the worm of time would eat out the very heart of it, the ſhortneſs of the continuance would ſpoyl the ſport. Many doat on beauty, but none but the blind will fall in love with deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it ſelf. The world is a <hi>Bochim,</hi> a place of Lamentation, and who falls in love with ſorrow? 'tis a <hi>Golgotha,</hi> a place of dead mens
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:34727:62"/>skuls, and who but mad men converſe among the Tombs? 'Tis a peſt-houſe, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and an infecting place, where moſt we converſe with are infectious: 'tis a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a place of hardſhip, where the ſoul hath not liberty to act according to its nature: 'tis a place of <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage and ſlavery, where there is little but moiling, toyling, working, caring, from morning till night, for a poor living, wherein we are ſo chained to our Oars, that we have ſcarce time to eat our meat; and what madneſs is it over eagerly to deſire ſuch a life, and to quarrel thoſe that eaſe us of our burden, and put an end to our labours? Here thou liveſt under continual pains, aches, griefs, and troubles, ſorrows, dangers and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and what not; and is any poor priſoner lying in his fetters, or Gally-ſlave chained to his oars, unwilling of his liberty? nay would they not endure a little pain for their liberty? and is there but a little pain between thee and eternal happineſs, and doſt ſtick at that, when wicked men indure as much in the road to Hell? doſt thou prize glory at ſo low a rate? wilt thou ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer pains and labour, and cark and care for worldly vanities, and wilt thou ſuffer nothing to enjoy bliſs and happineſs? the Phyſitian cures thee not without pain, thou takeſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34727:62"/>pills and unſavoury potions, when Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred with the hopes of Health; thou wouldſt ſuffer the Surgeon to dreſs thy ſores though he hurt thee, and if need require to cut, lance the fleſh, yea to cut off a limb or joynt to ſave the reſt; which is greater pain than many feel even in the pangs of death, and yet thou muſt pay them for their pains, and ſhall only the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian Death, which will cure thee of all thy pain and miſery, be diſreſpected, and abhorred, and lookt upon as the worſt of enemies, and all becauſe he puts thee to a little pain, which ends in eternal glory; when many times the pains in dying is not ſo much as the raging pain of an aking tooth? but imagine it to be the worſt thou canſt, what proportion doth it bear to the ſucceeding joy? not ſo much as is between a Flea-biting and an earthly Crown, and who would not indure much more for a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? what pain wouldſt thou indure for an hour, to be freed from the Stone or Gout all thy life, if thou wert under the racking pain of it? or what pain would a poor man indure one day to have a Knights or Lords eſtate at night? Oh death, if thy pangs be grievous, they are but ſhort, but what are the pains of Hell, which muſt be indured by thoſe that deny their Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34727:63"/>for Lifes ſake? If thy Supper be ſharp, thy reſt will be ſweet: this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration made death it ſelf welcom to the Martyrs; <hi>who for the joy that was ſet before them, indured the croſs and deſpiſed the ſhame,</hi> and now are ſet down with Chriſt in his Kingdom of glory: Torments and tortures to them were <hi>Jocularia,</hi> matters of ſport: The ſoul that ſees the Crown, heeds not the weight of the Croſs; and were there no other way to Heaven, but by the gates, nay through the flames of Hell, the believing ſoul would through. <hi>Luther</hi> would rather be with God in Hell, than without him in Heaven; but much more would they go through the gates of death: what though the paſſage be dark, a believer by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective of Faith can ſee light at the other end. A Souldier that fights but for a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary reward, yet with what violence doth he preſs through the thickeſt of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and carries his life in his hand, and all for a thing of nought call'd Honour; and doth not a crown of glory ſhine as bright in thy eye, as popular applauſe doth in his? doſt thou believe eternal glory is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to thee, and that thou maiſt have it for the ſuffering a little pain, and doſt thou ſtick at the price, and let God beſtow his favours where he pleaſeth, thou wilt not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34727:63"/>have Heaven at ſo dear a rate? thou art well worthy then to loſe it. If theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward enjoyments will give thee content, then the <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> the <hi>Epicure,</hi> the beaſtly belly-God, the Drunkard, the Adulterer, hath more pleaſure than thee; the beaſt of the field, the fouls of the air, the fiſh in the ſea, that have neither carking care, nor fretting fear, and many of them free from labours and pains, are in a happier condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than poor Man is, if this be his all, and Believers then are of all men the moſt miſerable. If this be the ſumm of thy hopes, why doſt thou faſt, and pray, and deny thy ſelf theſe carnal pleaſures which others take? if their reward will give thee content, why doſt not ſwear with the Swearer, and drink with the Drunkard, and debauch thy ſelf with the Adulterer? if thy portion and theirs be alike, why doſt <hi>not run into the ſame exceſs of riot with them?</hi>

Is God willing to glorifie thee,

'Tis the Devils grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to keep thee from God, from Chriſt, from Glory, and art thou as willing as he to ſtay thence? thou wilt do him the greateſt courteſie, and thy ſelf the greateſt miſchief imaginable. O my Soul, look well about thee, Heaven and Hell are before thee, if thou like not Heaven upon the offered terms, Hell is like to be thy portion: thoſe that murmured at the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> by reaſon of ſome difficulty in the way, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the Wilderneſs. The way to Heaven and Hell, is both by the Gates
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34727:64"/>of Death; if thou give up thy life to Gods diſpoſe, Heaven will be thine; if not, Hell is thy reward. Oh my God, I believe, help my unbelief; I know I muſt dye, I know 'tis my duty to dye for thee if thou requireſt; thou gaveſt me my life, and haſt moſt reaſon to diſpoſe of it; Lord my Spirit is willing, but the Fleſh is weak, I cannot ſtand by my own Strength, Lord I can do all things through thee that ſtrengtheneſt me; let my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves be for Heaven, which way ſoever thou commandeſt me to come to thee, though through a Sea of Blood, or in a fiery Chariot; let me glorifie thee by my Life and by my Death, that I may be glorified by thee after my Death.</p>

As thy life is not put into thy own hands, to live while thou liſteſt, and to dye when thou pleaſeſt, no more is it into thy enemies hands, to take it away when their pleaſure is; but in the hand of thy mercifull Father, who beſt knows when thy work is done, and when thou art ripe for glory.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:34727:68"/>his Executioners, and wicked men can do no more; to the one or the other of them thou muſt ſubmit, and not much matter to which; to neither of them thou ſhould ſubmit willingly, but to God in both: thou ſhouldſt ſeek all lawful means againſt the one and the other, but nothing but what is lawful: when God denies help, go not to the Devil for a medicine; to ſubmit to death when thou canſt not help it is no praiſe-worthy thing: when thou canſt ſave thy life by unlawful means, and wilt not, this ſhall not be unreward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a Crown of glory will be given thee. He deſerves death that in time of danger deſerteth his Captain, and falls off to the enemy. Keep thy life thou canſt not without his leave, and if thou lay it down for his ſake, 'tis not the way to loſe it but to ſave it, <hi>to hide it with God in Chriſt;</hi> and doth not Reaſon tell thee, he is fitteſt to diſpoſe of thy life that gave it? he is too righteous to do thee wrong, and too gracious to do thee hurt; never was indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Father, or tender-hearted. Mother more carefull of their only Child, than God will be of thee; thou ſhalt not lye longer in the furnace than need is: <hi>he afflicts not willingly nor grieves the children of men:</hi> thou art but like a ſleepy child, that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34727:68"/>wreſts, and wrings, and cries, and will not be undreſt; and thy Father muſt carry thee to bed againſt thy will; and what harm hath he done then? when thou awakeſt thou wilt thank him for it. When Corn is ripe it ſhould be cut, and who is fitter to know when 'tis ripe than the great Husbandman? when thy work is done thou maiſt go to thy reſt, and who better knows than the Lord of the Vineyard? if that he take thee off in the midſt of thy day, and give thee the wages for the whole day, what cauſe is there of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint? Nay, ſhould he give thee the whole wages for one hours work? if God call thee off, 'tis not to ſtop thy wages, or to blame thee for working no longer. Thou muſt ſubmit to the ſtroak of death, and do it willingly, whether it be natural or violent; for conſider, God hath moſt right to thy life, and is the fitteſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to determine of the Manner of thy death: He gives men Laws to live by, and yet many will take their own wills and waies, to their own deſtruction; he gives men Laws to dye by, look that thou follow not thy own will to perdition; thou art but a Tenant at will, if thou reſign not at thy Landlords will, it will be the worſe for thee; he will never provide a better
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34727:69"/>houſe, but a Priſon for thee; he is the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to determine when to pull down theſe houſes of clay, and who ſhall do it; and if thou willingly ſubmit, he will raiſe thee up a Spiritual building, <hi>an houſe not made with hands, but eternal in the Heavens.</hi> Is it not unreaſonble for thee to think to keep the keyes of life and death at thy girdle? why ſhouldſt thou think to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of thy death any more than of thy birth, or of thy latter end more than thou didſt of thy beginning? it was <hi>through him that thou waſt born,</hi> and at his diſpoſe ſhall be thy death: if thou wouldſt wring this key out of Gods hand, into whoſe hands wouldſt thou commit it? is any in the world fitter for it, than he is? nay, can any other in the world preſerve thy life? thou art the clay and he is the Potter, and whoſe is the Pot but the pot-makers? and who may better daſh it with his foot than he? may he not diſpoſe of his own as he pleaſeth? he is beſt able to maintain life, and beſt able to take it away; for if he tread upon thee, he leaves thee dead behind him: if he with-hold thy breath, thou returneſt to thy duſt, and all thy thoughts pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. Doth not he rule in Heaven and in the Earth? doth not he direct the Sun, the Moon and the Stars in their courſes?
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34727:69"/>doth not he cauſe Summer and Winter, Cold and Heat, Seed-time and Harveſt, Day and Night, and thou letſt him alone with theſe? and why? becauſe thou canſt not take this work out of his hand: he makes the Graſs to grow for the Cattel, and Corn for the ſervice of Man; he wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the earth with his Clouds, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Springs to run among the Hills; why doſt not take theſe out of his hand? or muſt he rule all the reſt, and only thee muſt be excepted? hath he more wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom than thou haſt in all other things, only in the diſpoſing of thy life thou out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witteſt him? why, art thou not his creature as well as others? and how cam'ſt thou from under his dominion? doth it beſeem a rational man, much leſs a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious man, to argue at this rate, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept himſelf from Gods diſpoſe, and argue himſelf from under his tuition, and think himſelf to be an independent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, fit to ſtand upon his own legs? Doth not he know beſt when his work is done, and when his Roſes are ripe, and when his Children are fit for glory? or is any other fitter to determine theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies? or wouldſt thou diſpoſe of thy own life? if ſo, wouldſt have all men have the ſame priviledge? then Heaven,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34727:70"/>eſpecially Hell, would be long empty; for what wicked man would leave the Earth to go thither? and God muſt be beholding to his people to come to him: how ſhould Judgment and Juſtice then be executed? the ſword of Juſtice would ruſt in the Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard; for what offender would lay down his head upon the block willingly? How would the Earth then be filled with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and all flagitious crimes? if thou wouldſt not have others have the like privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, then thou art partial; if thou wouldſt, thou art fooliſh: but if it were at thy own diſpoſe, how couldſt maintain it? Thou couldſt neither provide thy ſelf food, neither could thy life be preſerved by food without Gods bleſſing; neither couldſt thou preſerve it from the hands of violence; and therefore 'tis beſt leave it in his hands where it is: or wouldſt have God preſerve thy life as long as thou pleaſeſt, and till thou think 'tis fit to dye? why doſt think thou canſt put ſuch a clauſe into the Covenant? or doſt think 'tis fit it ſhould be put in? wouldſt thou have God alter his eternal decrees for thy ſake? Oh the folly of ſuch a conceit! the pride of ſuch a deſire! thou thinkeſt the life of the bruit beaſt ſhould be at thy diſpoſe, to ſave or to deſtroy, as thou thinkeſt fit, and yet thou thinkeſt thou doſt them no
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:34727:70"/>wrong if thou kill them; and why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou calleſt them thy own: but hath not God a better right to thee than thou haſt to them? He gave thee thy life, but thou gaveſt them not the life thou takeſt. But 'tis a violent death thou feareſt, and wouldſt not fall into thine enemies hands; but if God make them his Meſſengers, they are thy Friends, though unwillingly, and promote thy glory; they cannot act without him, and therefore look not at the rod, but at the hand that holds it. The King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> was ſent as a ſcourge by God to do his work,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 10.7.15.</note> to reform his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; <hi>Howbeit he meaneth not ſo, neither doth his heart think ſo; but it is in his heart to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, and to cut off nations not a few,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Shall the Ax boaſt it ſelf againſt him that heweth therewith? or ſhall the Saw mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify it ſelf againſt him that ſhaketh it,</hi> &amp;c? All are but inſtruments in the hand of God, they do his will, and what he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points; as <hi>Jehu</hi> cut off <hi>Ahabs</hi> family at his command, yet God puniſht him for it, becauſe he aimed not at Gods glory in the work, but at his own greatneſs: wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men can neither maintain their own lives, when God calls for them, neither can they take away thine by their own power; for they can have no power but
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34727:71"/>what they have from above; and if thou ſee Gods hand and ſeal to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, murmur not at it, for 'tis not want of love to thee that made God ſet them on work, nor any love to them that made him imploy them; but it was to fill up the meaſure of their ſins, that they may be ripe for Judgment, and to fill up the meaſure of thy ſufferings, that thou maiſt be ripe for glory. The ſame love that ſent Chriſt into the world to dye for thee, is exerciſed in ſending thee to dye for him; in the one he prepared a King dom for thee, in the other he calls thee out of the world to enjoy it. By Chriſts death there is a poſſeſſion purchaſed, and by thy death thou art put into the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it; and what hurt is in all this? there is thy life, yea Eternal Life, put into the leaſe of it.

                  <hi>the everlaſting counſeller, the Prince of peace; who knows how to deliver his people, and to reſerve the wicked for the day of wrath:</hi> they cannot hide their counſels from him, for he is every where preſent; if they dig down to Hell, he is there alſo, and can countermine them; he hath wrought wonderfully for the preſervation of his people; witneſs <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> the <hi>three children, Jonah, Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Hamans</hi> time, <hi>Peter, Athanaſius, Luther, Calvin, England;</hi> and many others, which he hath preſerved againſt numerous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And for love never any hath diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered more than Chriſt hath done for his people, and yet canſt not truſt Him with the diſpoſe of thy life, that loſt his own for the good of thy ſoul? Thou canſt truſt thy life in a narrow Ship upon the raging Sea, for gain, if thou think thou haſt a skilful careful <hi>Pilot,</hi> and dareſt not ſail in thoſe narrow ſeas to the port of Reſt, and Haven of happineſs, when God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is thy <hi>Pilot,</hi> and ſteers thy Ship, when never any miſcarried in the voyage? Thou canſt truſt a Lawyer with thy Eſtate, if thou think him honeſt and able, and doſt miſtruſt the everlaſting <hi>Counſeller</hi> with thy eternal Eſtate, who neither can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34727:72"/>or be deceived? Thou wouldſt truſt a skilful Phyſitian with thy Body, and take bitter pills and unſavoury potions if he preſcribe them, and dareſt thou not put thy life into the hands of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician of Souls, in compariſon of whom all others are <hi>Phyſicians of no value,</hi> becauſe he preſcribes a little unpleaſing Phyſick, though no bitterer than needful? If thou miſtruſt him with thy life, either 'tis becauſe thou feareſt he will deceive thee, or may be deceived; but this intrenches upon his wiſdom or fidelity; 'tis better for a child be under his Fathers protection than his own; much more for thee to be under Gods tuition, than at thy own diſpoſe: he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet betrayed his truſt, neither <hi>can any pluck thee out of Gods hands;</hi>

                  <hi>he will never leave thee nor forſake thee;</hi> and that <hi>the gates of Hell ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt thee?</hi> and dareſt not take his word? was he ever known to falſify it?

Never fear, if thou carry thy Evidences for Heaven with thee, he will never diſinherit thee. Chriſt will not loſe the purchaſe of his blood, and thou ſhalt not loſe what he hath purchaſed for thee. If it be good for thee to dye, why wouldſt thou live? A child cannot chooſe ſo well for himſelf as his Father can; and God knows better than thee what is belt: Many are loth to open a Vein, and yet in ſome caſes 'tis beſt; yea to cut off a Limb may be neceſſary, though painful; the ſenſual faculty here muſt be ruled by the rational: that is not alwaies beſt that is moſt pleaſing to the Appetite. If thou leave it to God what death thou ſhalt dye, he will make the beſt choice for thee, he will lay no more upon thee than he gives thee ſtrength to bear; and through <hi>Chriſt aſſiſting thee thou maiſt do all things.</hi> Truſt not in thy own ſtrength, leſt with <hi>Pembleton</hi> thou faileſt in the performance.

Thy enemies, as before was ſaid, are not Maſters of thy life, neither is it in their power to take it away; for they have no power but what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from Heaven: 'tis he that diſpoſes of Angels and Men, of Crowns and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, of Heaven and Earth, that muſt diſpoſe of thy life, and is not he the fitteſt for the work? is there any in the world can do it better? is there any in the world thou hadſt rather truſt with thy life? is not he the fitteſt to ſend for thee out of the world, that ſent Chriſt into the world for thy ſake? and wilt thou think thy life too dear for him, that thought
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:34727:73"/>not the pangs of death, nor the pains of Hell too much to ſuffer for thee? hath he ſuffered ſo much to purchaſe glory, and wilt thou ſuffer nothing to enjoy it? his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering was a thouſand times more for thee, than thine is like to be for him, or rather for thy ſelf; for thou hadſt the benefit of his death, but he will have none by thine: hath he provided a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and wilt not leave thy Cottage to go to it? Death 'tis true is ſurly and grim, but 'tis thy Fathers Meſſenger, and muſt do the meſſage he gives in charge; and 'tis an Ambaſſador from the great King, and Ambaſſadors are entertained not for their own, but their Maſters ſake, and death may be welcomed for the meſſage ſake he brings: He comes to tell thee, that thy work is done, and thy wages is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, thy Warfare is accompliſhed, the Field is won, and the Crown is thine;

How unſuitable is it for ſuch to be terrifyed with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of it! but the thoughts of the Immortality, and the Incorruptibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Spirituality and Glory of the body at the Reſurrection, ſhould drown the noiſe, ſilence the doubts and fears of the danger that lies in the way, and the pains and pangs of death it ſelf. The pains of death to theſe are worſe than being dead; and this is but a flea-biting to the joy that follows; but to the wicked the pain of dying is nothing in compariſon of the conſequences of death, and the tormenting pains of the ſecond death: for were Hell no worſe than the pangs which dying men ſuffer, it were not ſo formidable.

The apprehenſion of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching death is not the ſame to thoſe men and to others, that believe that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:34727:83"/>death will end all their miſeries, and land them into everlaſting happineſs; the ſame Judge abſolveth the innocent, and condemns the guilty; and thoſe men have not the ſame apprehenſions of him, the one longs for his coming, the other fears it. 'Tis rather a wonder, that the Saints that have aſſurance of their future glory, do not long for the time of their diſſolution, and ſeek to haſten it by ſome illegal way, than uſe any indirect means to live when they are called to dye: I know the former is unlawful, for we muſt keep our ſtation, while God appoints us; and ſo is the latter, for we muſt come off the Centinel when he calls us: but it is more natural to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire happineſs than miſery, and to uſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct means to procure the former than the latter. We read in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, when many Chriſtians were to ſuffer, of a Woman and her children that were haſting to the place, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing met by one of the perſecutors, who demanded whither ſhe went, and why ſhe made ſo much haſte, ſhe anſwered. She was a Chriſtian, and hearing many Chriſtians were that day to ſuffer, ſhe haſted with her children to ſuffer with them, and feared leſt ſhe ſhould come too
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:34727:83"/>late. <hi>Ignatius</hi> was afraid leſt the Prayers of the Church ſhould prevent him of ſuffering for Chriſt, and of his Crown of Martyrdome: Theſe had not ſuch fearful apprehenſions of death as thou ſeemeſt to have. Sure thoſe that look for perfection by death, ſhould not be afraid of it; and if theſe tabernacles of our bodies muſt down, what matter is it whether they are taken down, or burnt down, ſeeing the materials both waies will be preſerved; the one turns them to duſt, the other to aſhes; and in a little time they will moulder of themſelves into duſt. Death to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is but a parting of two intimate friends, the Soul and the Body, for a time; and both the one and the other will be gainers by the ſeparation; the Soul goes immediately to Heaven, and the Body lies in the grave for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſhall thence be raiſed in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable glory, and God will build it up again an habitation for the ſoul, at his own proper coſt and charges: Death to them is but a Gaol-delivery, where the ſoul that hath been long a priſoner ſhall be ſet at liberty; 'tis but the bodies ſleep, and the Souls awaking; the bodies death and the Souls reſurrection; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:34727:84"/>the Soul ſhall be freed from all thoſe clogs which now preſſeth it down, that it cannot mount up into thoſe heavenly Regions, and it ſhall live with God bleſſed for ever to eternity; and is this a thing to be feared?

This is the godly mans Purgatory, and ſhould he not rather pray to be delivered out than continued in it? 'tis his Hell, all the Hells he is like to have, and ſhall he take up his ſtation here, among miſeries, and troubles? hadſt thou in thy youthful daies had liberty to appoint out thy own time, and bound the tearm of thy life, haply thou mighteſt have thought the time thou haſt already lived had been competent; and truely if there be much more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, thou maiſt well fore-ſee it will be burthenſome to thy ſelf, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to others, by reaſon of thine infirmities.

Oh

Many that have had a ſhorter time, have done a great deal more work in it than thou haſt done. If thou live long, thy corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will not dye for age; a hard winter will not kill the weeds of ſin, theſe may flouriſh when thy body decayes, and old age is not the fitteſt time for reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for preparation: Old age is like an old Tree, it will hardly bend, when a young tree is pliable: when thou comeſt to give an account of ill-ſpent time, thou wilt

If thou improve thy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents well, and God take them quickly out of thy hand, he will never blame thee thou hadſt them no longer, nor require an account of thee for the time thou hadſt them not: 'tis fit the Maſter not the Servants ſhould determine what talents each one ſhould have, and how long; for 'tis fit he diſpoſe of his own goods as he pleaſeth.

The love of Chriſt in the <hi>Martyrs</hi> was hotter than the flames they burnt in; they could cry out, <hi>None but Chriſt, none but Chriſt:</hi> true love deſires union with the party beloved: and how canſt thou ſay thou loveſt Chriſt, when thy heart is not with him, when thou deſireſt not his company, or to enjoy him? thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeſt love to him, and yet art willingly, deſirouſly abſent from him, and wilt not come to him at his call, but wilt rather deny him, and thy intereſt in him: thou cal'ſt him thy Husband, and pretendeſt

But it may be 'tis not thy diſpute whether Heaven or Earth be the better choice, but thy own Intereſt that thou queſtioneſt; ſome enjoyments thou haſt here, and loth thou art to leave them till thou art ſure of better: but hath not this been thy obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction many years? and haſt not yet got over this ſtile? why how haſt thou ſpent thy time? what haſt thou been doing? what is the reſult of thirty or forty years trial of the eſtate? hadſt any greater work lay upon thy hand? did not God ſend thee into the world upon this very bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and haſt thou ſpent thy time in hunting Butter-flyes, or weaving the Spiders web to catch flyes all this while? how canſt eat, or drink, or ſleep in quiet, without ſome comfortable aſſurance, when thou knoweſt not but the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou mayſt awake with hell-flames about thy ears? thou art ſent to run a race, to fight a fight, to lay hold upon Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by violence, and haſt all this while ſate idle?

Many have more diſtempers in their Souls than in their Bodies; 'tis true, this is thy caſe, yet thou haſt hoped thine are not mortal, the malignity of the diſeaſe is over, when many others have Plague-Sores running upon them; theſe may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect death, and have cauſe to fear it; it will but heal thy diſtempers, but inrage theirs: thou haſt had many meditations of death, and many diſcourſes with death, and you did ſeem pretty well agreed; thou haſt

The Grave is but a Bed of Roſes, perfumed by the Body of Chriſt, a reſting Chamber, a Repoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory where God lays up his Jewels, wherein thy duſt will be kept as in a Cabinet, and not one grain of it ſhall be loſt,

Death brings in the Harveſt of thy hopes, the fruit of thy Prayers, the reward of thy pains, and of all the loſſes and ſufferings thou haſt had for Chriſt: God is now ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for thee to make thee a King, and wilt thou now withdraw thy ſelf like <hi>Saul,</hi> and hide thy ſelf as he did, when they ſought him to make him King? here lyes the perfection and end of thy Faith, and of thy Hope, the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of thy Soul; for theſe Graces as

               <p>OH my Soul, what is it that thou doſt boggle at? Death thou heareſt can do thee no hurt, why then doſt thou fear it? O! but 'tis a violent death thou feareſt;
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:34727:120"/>were it but a natural death, thou couldſt ſubmit to it; but to fall into the hands of the uncircumciſed, into the hand of bloody and deceitful men, whoſe loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is cruelty; this thou canſt not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly bear: all Death offers violence to nature, and to be willing to dye by thy Enemies hand, thou art not preſt to; uſe all unlawful means to eſcape, but no means but what is lawful: thou muſt be willing to ſubmit to God, and when he manifeſts this to be his will, thou muſt chearfully ſuffer it; but I fear this is but a Fig-leaf to cover a little Faith: well, let us argue the caſe: To dye thou ſeemeſt willing, but thou muſt chooſe thy death, and God muſt have no hand in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; thou wouldſt go to him, but he muſt not ſend for thee, eſpecially by ſuch a meſſenger thou likeſt not of: This is Childrens play, they would do any thing but what they are bid do; go any whither but to School, learn in any Book but their own. But doſt really think that thou art fitter to determine the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of thy Death than God? the time when, the place where, and the manner how? or will God accept of thee for a Councellor in this caſe? and what difference is there between the one and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:34727:121"/>the other? one ſtops thy breath, and ſo will the other; one ſets an end to thy temporal being, and ſo doth the other; the conſequences are the ſame, and the pains of the natural death may be as great, or greater than the other; wouldſt thou chooſe ſome violent diſtemper, ſome raging diſeaſe, ſome violent pain to end thy life? Nay, this thou likeſt not neither; hadſt thou the Stone, the Strangury, the Collick, the Gout, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this might make thee live a dying life, and make thee weary of thy life, and with <hi>Job</hi> chooſe <hi>ſtrangling rather than life;</hi> and hadſt rather endure this, than a few minutes pain from the hands of man? I fear this excuſe is but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long thy time, but buy not time at ſo dear a rate: thou ſeemeſt careful not to come to Heaven too ſoon, nor honour God too much by thy Death, but take heed of wringing thy life out of his hands; dye thou wilt, thou ſayeſt, but it muſt be when thou cauſt live no longer, and then no thanks to thee, patience per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force is a Medicine for a mad Dog: doth not Death, whether by a Diſeaſe, by the Sword, or at the Stake, ſignifie much the ſame thing as to the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of Death? only the latter, if it
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:34727:121"/>be in the cauſe of Chriſt, ſpeaks thee more a Chriſtian, and entitles thee to a Crown of Martyrdom, and will encreaſe thy happineſs. Death, at which door ſoever it comes in, ſeparates between the Body and the Soul: but happily thou maiſt live a little longer by refuſing to dye for Chriſt, but will not a years enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God in Glory, be as delightful to thee as a year longer ſpent upon the Earth? and perhaps if the one be ſooner than the other, it may be with as little pain. But ſuppoſe God ſhould give thee thy choice, either to dye a natural Death the next year, or to dye by an enemies hand ſeven year after, which wouldſt thou chooſe? I ſuppoſe thou wouldſt ſeal to the longer Leaſe; If ſo, 'tis not a violent death thou feareſt, ſo much as a ſhort life: but if this be thy fear, to dye too ſoon, God may ſend thee a languiſhing life, <hi>and make thee long for death,</hi>

Seeing thy body muſt be reduced to duſt, 'tis no matter whether it rot above ground, or in it; no matter whether thou be burnt to aſhes, or moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to duſt, God will not loſe one grain of thy duſt: <hi>Kill me they may</hi> (ſaith the Martyr) <hi>hurt me they cannot; the worſt they can do, is but to ſend me to my Fathers houſe the ſooner.</hi> The love of Chriſt in the Martyrs, was hotter than the Flames they burnt in, and much allayed the heat of the Fire, that ſome of them felt little or no pain. <hi>O ye Papiſts</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>ye look for a miracle, behold a miracle, for in this fire I feel no pain, it is to me as a bed of Roſes.</hi> They went as readily
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:34727:122"/>to dye as to dine, and accounted the day of their Death their Wedding day. <hi>Paul was ready not only to be bound, but to dye for Chriſt.</hi> Many were <hi>tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better reſurrection; they had Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of cruel mocking, ſcourging, yea bonds and impriſonments; they were ſtoned, ſawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, tempted, ſlain with the Sword; they wandred about in Sheep-skins and Goat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins,</hi>

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:34727:123"/>will honour; and thoſe that deſpiſe him, ſhall be lightly eſteemed:</hi> If thou come to ſuffer for him, as many eyes will be upon thee, ſo many Prayers will be put up for thee; and doubtleſs much comfort will be dropt into thy Soul by the Spirit of God, who is the Comforter, ſent by God upon this buſineſs: and God will ſtand by thee in ſuffering times, and give in Cordials to refreſh thy heart. I have read of a Chriſtian, that under his Rack and Tortures, as he after told his friends, apprehended a young man with a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief wiping the ſweat off his face, and comforting him. The holy Angels will ſtand by thee, and God will not be at a diſtance from his ſuffering Saints; and who then need fear to dye, that hath learnt to live? if thou be prepared, thou needſt not fear what Meſſenger God ſends for thee, nor at what hour of the night thy maſter comes; for Death cannot be ſudden to the prepared Soul, that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies upon his watch; and thou needſt not fear what thy ſufferings be, if thou canſt but ſay, <hi>Propter te, propter te Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne; 'Tis for thee, and for thy ſake we are killed all the day long, and accounted as Sheep for the ſlaughter.</hi> The more thou ſuffereſt then, the more deeply thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageſt
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:34727:123"/>God to thee, and he will pay thee an hundred fold; this is the beſt uſury, and the beſt way thou canſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of thy life, for every year on Earth that thou haſt loſt, thou ſhalt receive a thouſand in Heaven; and for one friend thou forſakeſt here, thou ſhalt receive a thouſand there; and for every thing thou loſeſt for his ſake, thou ſhalt be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed a thouſand fold; and as thou ſhalt have no loſs, ſo thy Enemies ſhall be no gainers by thy death; they heap up coals of fire upon their own heads, and (without repentance prevent it) aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their own damnation; for Chriſt will take it as done to himſelf; and their torments are like to be as durable as thy Joyes, which will be for ever and ever. Conſider not ſo much what thou ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, as for what, and for whom: if it be for the Truth, it will prevail; and if it be for Chriſt, thou ſhalt not loſe by it: Truth is more precious than life it ſelf, and fit to be ſealed with thy blood; thou muſt deny thy ſelf, rather than deny thy God; for he that gave thee thy life, is fitteſt to diſpoſe of it, and whoſoever parts with his life upon this account makes a good bargain; he cannot buy this Gold too dear.

Chriſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for thee the wrath of God, and wilt not thou ſuffer for him the wrath of man? he was ſtung by Death, and doſt think it much to be ſtrucken by it, now the ſting is out? he ſuffered for thee the pains of Hell, and think'ſt it too much to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the pangs of death for him, when many times it is not ſo much as ſome

This original corruption, with which thou art tainted, is virtually every ſin, for it is the Spawn of it: there is no ſin acted, but the ſeed of it lyes here; and hence it is thou art ſo diſpoſed to evil, and ſo averſe from good: there is no ſin ſo bad, but thou haſt an inclination to it, if this ſeed be watered with a temptation, if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining or Sanctifying grace of God prevent not; and no duty ſo good, but
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:34727:133"/>this ſets thy heart againſt it: the very Praiſing of God, that Angelical duty, is oppoſed by this original ſin. This ſin of Nature, this original corruption, is univerſal, and that makes it much worſe; univerſal in reſpect of Time, even from the fall to the end of the world; no day free from this ſin; ſome ſin reigns moſt in ſome Ages, this in every Age. Alſo in reſpect of Perſons, no meer man was ever free ſince the fall, no ſon of <hi>Adam</hi> or daughter of <hi>Eve:</hi> other ſins ſome perſons may be, and are little infected with, but this all ſtand infected with. And in reſpect of Parts, 'tis univerſal alſo; no power of the ſoul, no member of the body free from it; and 'tis continual and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, without any Intermiſſion; thou canſt not leave it behind in one duty. 'Tis ſaid, that ſome Serpents when they go to drink, lay by their poyſon, as alſo when they go to generate: This I know not, but this I am ſure of, thou canſt not lay aſide thy ſinful nature; yea, when thou makeſt thy Addreſſes to God himſelf, thou mayſt haply lay aſide the acting of ſin, but not being ſinful; for couldſt thou leave thy ſin behind thee, thou mighteſt have more ſweet commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:34727:133"/>with thy God in one Duty, than now thou canſt have in all thy duties; for 'tis ſin that ſtains all thy duties, and makes them ſignifie little to thee: and wert thou not in Chriſt, God would hate them, and throw them back into thy face with diſdain: 'tis thy ſin that makes thee take ſo much pains in duty to keep thy heart to God, this hides his face from thee, that thou canſt ſcarce have a glimpſe of him in an Ordinance; this is the Root upon which all other ſins grow, the Spring that feeds all the ſtreams of vice; and hence they iſſue: and this is it upon which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil faſtens all his temptations: the want of this made the Devil ſucceſſeleſs in his tempting of Chriſt; his fire fell upon wet Tinder; and this is the miſery of it, this ſin never dyes for age, but the longer we live the ſtronger it grows: ſome ſins are in a decaying condition as to the Act, when age diſables an Adulterer, and ſome others, but this decayes not: yea and we propagate it alſo to our Poſterity, our children receive it from us, and ſo it will be propagated from one generation to another to the worlds end. Oh the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid nature of this ſin! 'tis the Image of Satan, which he ſtampt upon us when the image of God was loſt, and this cannot
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:34727:134"/>be raſed out, but by death: here thou art troubled with a hard heart, a ſtubborn will, diſordered affections, unruly paſſions, vain thoughts, idle imaginations, which thou canſt not ſhake off more than thy ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nature: this makes thee ſo unlike to God, ſo like to Satan whoſe Image thou beareſt, and whoſe work thou doeſt; this makes thy duties ſtink in the noſtrils of God, and thy whole man, Soul and Body out of order; this hinders thy communion with thy God, and makes him a ſtranger to thee; it makes thee act as an enemy to him, and him to thee, and thy iniquity hides his face from thee. Theſe are the <hi>Anakims</hi> that terrifie thee, theſe are the ſons of <hi>Zerviah</hi> that are too hard for thee, theſe are the <hi>Caananites</hi> which are thorns in thine eyes and pricks in thy ſides, theſe ſins of thine are the cauſe of all thy trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; thou hadſt never had aking head, or aking heart, or loſs, or croſs, or any thing to trouble thee, had it not been for ſin, but from theſe thou canſt not be freed one moment: no Prayer, no Duty, no Action, but ſavours of them; this thou art ſenſible of, this burden thou groaneſt under, and lookſt upon ſin as thy greateſt enemy; and well thou maiſt, for nothing could hurt thee but for this; this it is
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:34727:134"/>that makes the ſoul vulnerable, which otherwiſe man nor Devil could not hurt; this thou haſt preached againſt, ſpoke againſt, prayed againſt; thou haſt railed upon it, and called it all that naught is; well now let us ſee whether thou waſt in Earneſt or in Jeſt, whether all this was in ſincerity, or hypocriſie; death comes now to free thee from this bondage, eaſe thee of this burden, and brings a potion to cure thee when all other Doctors have left thee, and can do no good: he will bring thee where ſin and ſorrow ſhall be no more; for into heaven they ſhall never enter: art thou willing of the ſeperation, to give ſin a bill of divorce, and put it away? wilt thou ſhake hands with it, and bid it adieu for ever? this potion will purge the ſoul from all the reliques of this diſtemper, and cleanſe the heart which is the fountain of all thy actions, and make all the ſtreams thence proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing run clear, and fetch away all thoſe groſs humours of ſin, that filthy lump that lyes upon thy heart, and preſſeth it down, and lyes as a clog upon it; it will caſt out all thoſe unclean Spirits, and cleanſe thoſe <hi>Augean</hi> Stables from all pollution: this is the only Phyſitian in the world that can do it, and God
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:34727:135"/>the great Phyſician of Souls hath approved of his Recipts, and ſent him to thee upon this errant, to heal thee of the wounds of ſin, and to reſtore thee to thy pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive purity, wherein thou waſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: what ſaiſt thou, wil't give him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment or no? The Devil and the damned would take a potion a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times bitterer upon the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: help thou canſt not have, till thou art purged, nor to Heaven thou canſt not go, <hi>for no unclean thing ſhall ever enter there;</hi> purged thou canſt not be without death; for then Chriſt will waſh thee clean with his own blood, and ſprinkle thee with clean water, and preſent thee to his Father without ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch defiling or deforming thing, and cure thee of all thy ſoul diſtempers and bodily infirmities, which ſhall never more ſeize upon thee, he will ſay to ſin and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row as unto the unclean ſpirit, <hi>Go out of him,</hi>

                  <hi>and enter no more into him.</hi> Theſe ſins be they that keep thee under the hatches, that thou canſt not ſerve God without diſtractions, but death will unpinion thy wings, and let thy ſoul at liberty, and then thou ſhalt never be troubled with vain thoughts or imaginations more, thou ſhalt never
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:34727:135"/>ſpeak vain word more, or do any ſinful action more: what wouldſt thou give for thy freedom from ſin for one month, or one year? and what now wilt thou give for a perpetual freedom? what doſt thou yet hang back, and art not willing to ſuffer one hours pain for it? is this thy Love to God, which thou haſt profeſſed, that when thou art put to thy choice, thou chooſeſt ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him? is this thy hatred of ſin, that now thou art loth to leave it when it comes to the trial? is this the fruits of thy prayer, preaching and profeſſion? Art thou now at a ſtand, whether to deny thy God or thy Sin, and art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to chooſe ſin rather than God? and hadſt rather be preſent with ſin, and abſent from God? and hadſt rather live in the ſuburbs of Hell, than dye and come to Heaven? and hadſt rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy ſin for ever, than God for ever? for till death hath paſſed over thee, thou canſt not be free from ſin, neither canſt thou enjoy Happineſs: for Sin was born with thee, and will dye with thee; it hath an indwelling in the ſoul,

                  <hi>thou waſt ſhapen in iniquity and conceived in ſin.</hi> 'Tis as natural to thee as to live, 'tis thy very nature, 'tis thy very

'tis only in the Grave thou wilt be at reſt, and hid from ſin, which then cannot find thee, nor any miſeries which now are the effects of ſin nor from the temptations which are the inducements to ſin; and doſt thou yet tremble to part with ſuch an
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:34727:136"/>Enemy? thou haſt pretended Enmity to ſin, and been at Daggers drawing with it, and art now reconciled to it? it hath been thy trouble to have it, and is it now thy trouble to leave it? many a poyſoned Arrow the Devil hath ſhot at thee, and wouldſt ſtill be his <hi>Butt</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Arrows and venomous Shafts? Theſe Hell-hounds haunt thee, and will hunt thee till thou art in thy Grave; there they will loſe the ſcent and can fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thee no longer; here is thy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, thy hiding place, where thou art ſhut in by God, and ſecure; <hi>Here the weary are at reſt, here the Priſoners are ſecure, and hear not the voice of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſour;</hi> here thou ſhalt be freed from all that is called miſery. Sin is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious Tenant, or Inmate, it will not out till the houſe be pull'd down; yea, will turn the Landlord out of doors; Oh what hard hap had man to admit of ſuch a Gueſt! but this is thy comfort, ſin is but a Tenant at will; not at thy will, but the Will of God, who will ſhortly pull down the Houſe, and ſet thee at liberty; and Oh! thy madneſs, that though thou canſt no other way be rid of it, yet art unwilling to dye, and be happy. In Heaven, <hi>Paul</hi> ſhall never
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:34727:137"/>cry out, <hi>O wretched man that I am! who ſhall deliver me from this body of Death?</hi> Here the unclean converſations of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ſhall never vex the Soul of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Lot: David</hi> here ſhall never <hi>water his Couch with his tears,</hi> nor <hi>Jeremy</hi> wiſh his <hi>heart full of water, and his eyes a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of tears, to weep day and night for the deſtruction of his people.</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here that can procure miſery, for here ſin ſhall be ſhut out, for no unclean thing ſhall ever enter. But it is not ſin only, but ſorrow alſo as well as ſin ſhall be done away; for when the cauſe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the effect ſhall ceaſe. It was ſin that brought Death into the World, and all the forerunners of it, yea all the concomitants and conſequents of it; here thou art troubled with a ſickly body, ſubject to many infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, many pains, aches, griefs and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; ſcarce a waking hour free from pain, and from head to foot ſcarce a free part, but one pain or other doth moleſt it, ſome pain, ache or grief attends it; every ſenſe as 'tis an inlet to ſin, ſo 'tis to pain and miſery, to let in one trouble or other into the Soul, and help to affect the heart with ſome fear, or care, or grief, or trouble, and theſe conſume it as the ſcorching Sun the tender Flowers. Oh how tender a piece is this duſt-heap

All the faculties of thy ſoul will then bear a part in this tragedy; theſe will then
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:34727:147"/>tell thee; thy God, thy Saviour, thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, thy Heaven, thy happineſs, thy All is gone, everlaſtingly gone, paſt all hopes of recovery, and all thy hopes are daſht, and nothing left but endleſs, eaſleſs, and remedileſs torments.

Oh what a ſad, what a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful parting, will there then be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Soul and Body, expecting a ſad meeting! O curſed body, may the ſoul ſay, for thy ſake and at thy requeſt I have denyed my God, and now will he deny me: I was ſo indulgent to thee, I have undone my ſelf: to ſpare thee, I have wounded my ſelf: to ſave thee a little longer, I have procured eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to us both: to ſave a temporal life, we are like to dye eternally. Oh my ſoul! if by denying to dye for Chriſt, thy natural life be prolonged, yet thy ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al death will be haſtned, and after a few dayes this natural life, which now thou purchaſeſt at ſo dear a rate, will be required of thee, and God will ſend ſuch a meſſenger that ſhall not be reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted;

Thou muſt at death (and that is not far off) bid an everlaſting fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to all earthly enjoyments, never more to ſolace thy ſelf in any earthly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But were this the worſt, both the good and bad would fare alike; but here lyes the difference, the one parts with what he can well ſpare, the other with all his portion: the wicked at death part with all that is really as well as ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginarily good, not only temporals, but ſpirituals alſo. Thou muſt bid farewell to all the Holy Angels and glorified Saints, never more to enjoy their ſociety: They will be aſhamed of thoſe that are aſhamed of Chriſt, yea and rejoyce in thy deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Thou muſt then bid farewell to all
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:34727:148"/>thy carnal delights, to all thy merry company, and Jovial companions, and to all the things thou tookeſt delight in here below; yea to all the pleaſures, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and Joyes, at the right hand of God for evermore, thoſe rivers of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed Joyes and delights, which eye hath not ſeen, ear heard tell of, neither hath it entred into the heart of man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of; to theſe thou muſt bid an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal adieu, and in the room of them thou muſt have eternal miſery, wo and alas for evermore: And inſtead of this bleſſed company and holy ſociety, and theſe Celeſtial Joyes, be hurried with the Devil and the damned into the Lake of fire and brimſtone, out of which is no hope of redemption; and theſe ſhall be thy tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, and tormented companions. The place whither thou art to go is not any lightſome dwelling, but a dark dungeon, a diſmal priſon, the tongue of man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deſcribe it.

Here death might come in without knocking, and thoſe were moſt miſerable that lived

Here <hi>Dives</hi> lodgeth in flames of fire, inſtead of his ſoft bed; he is ſcalded with thirſt, and his ſweet cups are taken from him, and his food is new fire and brimſtone; and for his inſulting joy, he hath now gnaſhing of teeth.

The loſs of God will prove the greateſt loſs; the loſs of life is but a flea-biting in campariſon of it: for with him the ſoul is loſt alſo, yea the body which hath put thee upon ſo many temptations, and for whoſe ſake thou denyeſt Chriſt, ſhall then be loſt alſo; and both ſoul and body to thy eternal horror ſhall be made capable of theſe helliſh and eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For there ſhall be pain of ſenſe, as well as pain of loſs. 'Tis true, Divines
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:34727:149"/>do think the former is the worſt, the loſs of God, and all that good is; this ſets the worm of conſcience a gnawing which will never dye; but there is alſo fire which will never out: there is pain of ſence, as well as pain of loſs: And this is another part of Hell, let me lead thee a little by the hand, and let's take a view of this part alſo; let us look a little beyond death, at the dangers that follow it, and conſider when this earthly habitation ſhall moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into duſt, where thy dwelling ſhall be for ever. Let us take a view of Hell, which thou art to have into the bargain when thou ſoldeſt thy ſoul to ſave thy life, and with <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Demas</hi> choſeſt the world inſtead of Chriſt: let us view this region of the ſhadow of death, which is thrown in to thy bargain. But had I the tongue of men and Angels, I were never able to deſcribe the miſery of the damned in Hell, for no words in humane language can ſet it forth; the Devil himſelf whoſe portion it is, and the damned that feel it cannot do it, they cannot fully diſcover the worſt of a miſcarrying ſouls condition. If I could deſcribe eternity I might do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it, and yet I ſhould be at a loſs as to the torments themſelves: yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I may lead thee by the hand, and ſhew
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:34727:150"/>thee enough to convince thee that thou haſt made a fooliſh bargain, when thou denyedſt Chriſt to ſave thy life, and loſt thy ſoul to gain a little longer time in the world; and that this time thus gained was bought at a very great rate. The miſery of a miſcarrying ſoul is ſuch, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of it may ſend thee trembling to thy grave. Here thou truckleſt under a little pain, and groaneſt out thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, Oh my Head! Oh my Heart! Oh my Bones! Oh my Bowels! But all this while thou haſt ſome part free, no diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſeizeth univerſally upon all parts at once: or if it did, it reaches only to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; the ſoul which is the nobleſt part is free, this is not toucht: <hi>Thoſe that kill the body can do no more,</hi> they cannot reach the ſoul, but only as it ſympathizes with the body; but in hell there is no part free, either of Soul or Body, but all under helliſh tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Here if thy back ake, thy head may be well, or if thy bones ake, the heart may not be toucht; but in hell all parts are affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, not a finger free; the rich Glutton had not his tongue excepted,
<note place="margin">Luk. 16.25</note> neither could he get one drop of water to cool it, but he was wholly tormented in this flame. And not the body only, but the ſoul alſo muſt ſuffer torments, and that in every part,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:34727:150"/>power and faculty of it, no part of the ſoul or body free; and theſe helliſh pains are not only univerſal, but intolerable alſo, and yet muſt be endured: for the mighty God will preſerve the ſoul and body in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, inable them to live under theſe helliſh ſufferings. Here the poor creature falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the infinite wrath of the Great God, which <hi>like a river of brimſtone kindles this flame,</hi> which ſhall never go out,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 30.25.</note> which while God is God ſhall never ceaſe; and this helliſh fire ſeiſeth upon the ſoul and body as the fire doth upon the lump of pitch or brimſtone, which being once kindled never ſhall expire. Now though ſome few ſparks of this wrath have faln upon the world, yet the whole torrent of it is reſerved for hell; but we may judge of the Lion by his paw; one drop of this Ocean drowned the whole world, except eight perſons: and another drowned <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his army in the red Sea; one ſpark of it burnt up <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah, Admah</hi> and <hi>Zeboim,</hi> a little of it ſwallowed up <hi>Corah</hi> and his complices into the earth; ſlew twenty four thouſand <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at one time, and one hundred fourſcore and five thouſand of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacheribs</hi> Army in one night; and many times ruines Kingdoms, depopulates Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and layes a fruitful land waſte for the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:34727:151"/>wickedneſs of the inhabitants. Hundreds of examples may be given of this nature, but all this is but a flea-biting to Hell torments, which damned ſouls muſt undergo: all this reaches but the body, yet ſometimes ſome flaſhes light upon the ſoul, as fire into the the conſcience, as upon <hi>Cain, Judas, Spira, Satomias</hi> a <hi>Louvain</hi> Divine, which have made them weary of their lives; yea to chuſe ſtrangling rather than life, a <hi>wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Spirit who can bear?</hi> But all this is ſhort of the torments of Hell, which make up a compleat miſery; but what they are, we are at a loſs to know, and becauſe we cannot reach them, let us yet reach a little towards them. Thou haſt heard of, and in ſome meaſure felt tormenting diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, ſuch as the Stone, the Gout, the Strangury, the raging pain of aking teeth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe make mens lives uneaſy, yea ſometimes death deſirable; thoſe thus tormented deſerve pity, yea and are pitied by thoſe that ſee them: but alas this doth but darkly ſhaddow out theſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but we have read of ſome that have ſuffered greater than thoſe, inflicted by men haply inſtigated by the Devil; ſome have had their joints crackt upon the wheel, tortured upon the rack; others fley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alive, ſome have had their fleſh pull'd
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:34727:151"/>off their bones with red hot pincers, ſome have been pull'd in pieces with Wild Horſes, or the Arms of trees drawn together for that purpoſe, ſome have been burnt at the ſtake, ſome boiled in lead, ſome roſted alive upon Gridirons, iron chairs, or in frying pans, ſome hang'd up by the hand till they were dead, ſome ſawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, ſome famiſnt, ſome ſtarved to death, ſome put to one torture, ſome to another, whatever the wit of man or the policy of hell prompted the perſecutors to, to make their lives miſerable and their deaths painful; and this moved pity in ſome of the ſpectators: but ſhall we chuſe out the moſt exquiſite of all thoſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with the torments of hell, alas it bears no proportion; for though they were ſharp, yet ſhort. I have indeed read of ſome, by the great Tyrant commanded to be fleyed alive, and that they might be ſenſible of death, as he ſaid, it was done by degrees, that they were fourteen daies in dying: this was ſavage cruelty, but as the pains were ſhort of hell torments, for it only reacht the body, ſo fourteen dayes was far ſhort of eternity: but if all thoſe forementioned pains and tortures had been inflicted upon one man, and all the reſt that ever poor wretch ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:34727:152"/>and if this mans life had been preſerved under theſe torments one whole year, what heart, if not made of Adamant, but would lament him? moſt men would think him miſerable; yet this comes ſhort of the caſe in hand. Thoſe pains that reach the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy only, and touch not the ſoul, come ſhort of hell torments that reach both body and ſoul; and what is one year to eternity? theſe are invented by men, haply not without the advice of the Devil, but hell torments are deviſed by God, as a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient recompence for the breaking of his laws by men and Devils, where the ſoul, the nobler part of man, as well as the body, ſhall be tormented, which neither man nor Devil, but only God alone could do: the ſoul which ſhould have done God the greateſt ſervice, ſhall no doubt have the greateſt puniſhment; becauſe it ſhould have ruled the body, and yet did God the greateſt diſhonour, and the Devil the moſt work. The never dying worm, like <hi>Titius</hi>'s Vulture, will alwaies feed upon them, and yet they ſhall never be conſumed. It cannot be a hard bargain to part with a temporal life for an eternal. Nay it is not at thy diſpoſe, whether thou wilt dye or no; then it were not ſo much, though yet too egregious folly, for dye thou

In all other ſufferings thou mayſt have ſome reſpite, ſome eaſe, but in hell there is none; now thou grapleſt with a diſeaſe, or at worſt with a man, but in this with the Almighty. Here thou haſt ſome friends to comfort thee, to pity thee at leaſt; but there is neither comfort nor pity. The Devil and his Angels will rejoice in thy torments, for being tormented themſelves, they have no greater ſolace than in tormenting thee; here thou wilt be for ever helpleſs, and comfortleſs, and ſhalt not have ſo much as one drop of water to cool thy tongue.
<note place="margin">Lu. 16.24</note> Oh the folly of men, thus to fear a temporal death, and not to matter death eternal! to fear the wrath of man, and not the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Almighty God; to fear the death of the Body, and deſpiſe the death of the Soul; to fear the creature more than the Creator; that feareth the rage of man, and not the wrath of Almighty God.
<note place="margin">Gregory.</note> In hell there is death without death, and end without end, becauſe death ever liveth, and the end ever beginneth, for death will never dye. Oh how ſweet would death be there accounted, if it would take away life, and not compell thoſe to live that

Oh the ſtupidity of men, when a ſmall loſs will wring tears from their eyes, and an infinite and irrecoverable loſs is not regarded, yea the ſpeech of it they can digeſt with laughter. Many quake and tremble to come before an earthly Judge, and when they are going before the eternal Judge can ſport themſelves in the way; they fear to lanch forth into the Sea, and not to lanch forth into this infinite Ocean of Eternity: for hell torments are not only eaſeleſs, but endleſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſs. While there is life there is hope, but where the breath is gone, the hope is paſt: while the door is open there is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, but when 'tis once ſhut though thou knock it will not be opened. When the ſoul is ſeparated from the body of a wicked man, God will be ſeparated from the ſoul, and an uniting time will never come.

Oh Eternity, eternity, how amazing art thou? how ſhall we conceive of thee? how ſhall we caſt thee up?

<note place="margin">Job 9.14.</note> 
                  <hi>to him</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) that is afflicted, pity ſhould be ſhewed from his friends:</hi> But what is this to hell? or what is a few years to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? for in hell is no comfort, no eaſe, no refreſhment, neither any friend to pity; nay, if all the torments that ever poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures indured upon earth, whether inflicted by God himſelf, by man, or by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, could all light upon one man, and ſhould lye under them for hunderds of years, yet
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:34727:157"/>would it fall ſhort, for this would neither reach the pain, nor reach the duration; for when the miſcarrying ſoul hath lain in hell as many years as there are graſs piles upon the earth, drops of water in the Ocean, ſands upon the ſea ſhoar, hairs on all the mens heads in the world, and Stars in Heaven, yet the hundred thouſandth part of Eternity is not over: Oh eternity, how ſhall finite apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons conceive of thee? how ſhall we num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thee, or find out what thou art? we that live in time, and have but a little time given us here, cannot conceive of thee but by a long ſpace of time, as we cannot of Infinity of Eſſence, but by a vaſt quantity; we know God doth not number Eternity as we do Time; <hi>one day is with him as a thouſand years, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years as one day.</hi> For in eternity we need not trouble our ſelves to count the fleeting hours, neither daies nor years, for there is no Sun, Moon or Stars to be ſet for <hi>times and ſeaſons, or for daies or for years;</hi> but in hell is horrid darkneſs, <hi>blackneſs of darkneſs for ever.</hi> And whoſe heart may not tremble at the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it? ſhould all the Arithmeticians in the world joyn heart and hand and head and all, to caſt up the greateſt

Oh my ſoul, what think'ſt thou of it? wilt thou venture upon the pikes of danger? wilt thou deny the Lord that bought thee, and the God that made thee, to preſerve a miſerable life a little longer? Thou ſeeſt thy wages, and knoweſt thy reward; hadſt rather chuſe everlaſting damnation than a little temporal pain? and rather thruſt ſoul and body into eternal flames, and ſuffer the vengeance of eternal fire, rather then the pangs of a temporal death? Oh what madneſs hath bewitched thee! what folly haunts thee? how doth the Devil and the world delude thee? Thou that wouldſt cut off a limb or joint to preſerve the body from greater torture, wilt not be willing to endure a little to preſerve both body and ſoul from eternal ruine? Heaven and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:34727:158"/>Earth, and all wiſe men may ſtand amazed at thy folly. If thou turn thy back upon Chriſt, he will turn his back upon thee, and be aſhamed of thee: If thou make light of his Supper, thou ſhalt not taſt of his daintes. The queſtion, thou ſeeſt, is not whether death be deſirable or no, Nature it ſelf anſwers the contrary; but whether the firſt or ſecond death be the greater evil; and ſo whether is to be choſen, when both cannot be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? The queſtion is not, whether pain be eligible, but whether the pains of death or hell be the greater? Not whether life be deſirable, but whether life or Chriſt be the better? Whatever thy ſenſes may ſay, rectifyed Reaſon which ſhould go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the ſenſitive faculties will tell thee, the ſecond death is far more formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that 'tis better to deny thy ſelf than deny thy Redeemer.

Well may it be ſaid, there ſhall be no night there; but if this be not enough, God bleſſed for ever is more than all the light and glory of the place; ſo that there needs no Sun, for all the reſt borrow their light from him, and no Cloud ſhall ever cover his face, no Earth interpoſe between him and his Saints, or

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:34727:179"/>the morning Star.</hi> 'Tis a delightful thing to know the natures, the properties, the ends and uſes of natural things; 'tis a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy well beſeeming <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf, who ſpent much time this way; and many ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe points in Philoſophy there are which the greateſt wits are at a loſs about, and which they would give much to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; and Divinity it ſelf is not without its myſteries, and ſuch <hi>Arcana</hi> as will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be known while we are here: Alas, how little do we know about God, or the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and properties, offices and dignities of the Angels? nay, how little of our own Souls, about the Decrees, work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, Free will, and many more? but there nothing ſhall be hid; and no doubt there we ſhall have the knowledge one of another: for ſhall we <hi>ſit down with Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, and not know them?</hi> or did <hi>Dives</hi> know <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his boſom, and ſhall not the Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven know them? do they know one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this world after a little time of converſe, and when our knowledge is perfected will not eternity bring us to acquaintance? and doubtleſs the enjoyment of the Saints in glory will be part of the ſouls happineſs. Now all earthly delights
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:34727:179"/>to theſe heavenly Joyes are but a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, a very dream, the very dream of a ſhadow, to what is there enjoyed; where the glorified Souls ſhall be Kings and Prieſts for ever, of the moſt high God; they wear Crowns upon their heads, and palms in their hands, which they caſt down at the feet of him that liveth for ever. Theſe little flaſhes of ſpiritual Joy, (and indeed it is no more) will be blown up into a flame: here no fumes of Melancholy ſhall diſturb the Fancy, or interrupt the Joy. Malignant <hi>Saturn</hi> cannot ſend any influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence into theſe ſuperiour Orbs; but here is that <hi>far more and eternal weight of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to be enjoyed. O my ſoul, hadſt thou had but ſuch a glimpſe of Glory as <hi>Stephen</hi> had, thou wouldſt not have feared to have <hi>faln aſleep with him.</hi> Now thou art in the body, and abſent from God, but when death hath cloſed thine eyes, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy face with a winding-ſheet, thou ſhalt not only ſee God, but be preſent with him, and behold his glory. Now thy glimpſes of him are like a flaſh of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſoon gone; much like a man that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth at a Star through an Optick-glaſs held with a palſy hand; now and then thou catcheſt a ſight, but quickly loſeſt it again; but there he will alwayes be
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:34727:180"/>before thine eyes, thou ſhalt behold his face there, and not his back parts only; whether with bodily eyes or otherwiſe, is not well known, nor much material; 'tis probable it may, and the eye capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citated to behold the Object, though here 'tis dazled with a weaker glory: we find <hi>Job</hi> ſeems to be of that mind:
<note place="margin">Job 19.52. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>I know,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that my Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the earth; and though after my skin worms de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy this body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God, whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf, and mine eyes ſhall behold him, and not another, though my reins be conſumed within me.</hi> When this mortal hath put on immortality, and this body which is ſown a natural body become ſpiritual, we know not but theſe Organs of our eyes may be capacitated to behold ſpiritual objects, as well as our underſtandings be enabled to <hi>know him as he is.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.2.</note> This we know, God will make himſelf known, and that is ſufficient to us; whether the one way, or the other, let us not anxiouſly trouble our ſelves about the manner of it: this know, if God do not enlarge and capacitate our powers and faculties of the ſoul, we can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know him, ſee him, nor enjoy him as he is, which he hath promifed we ſhall
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:34727:180"/>do; and he that believeth in him and hath not yet ſeen him, ſhall ſee him on whom he hath believed: 'tis Chriſts prayer,
<note place="margin">John 17.24.</note> 
                  <hi>that thoſe that are given to him, may be where he is, to behold his glory;</hi> and if thoſe eyes were bleſſed, that ſaw him in his miſery, how much more thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him in glory? if the dawning of the day be ſo glorious, how much more glorious will it be when the Sun ſhines in his full ſtrength, and all the ſhadows are fled away? If thoſe that bear his Image here (and they are more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than their neighbours) be ſo lovely, what will they be when this Image of God is perfectly reſtored, and they freed from all corruption? here they have ſung forth his praiſes, then ſhall ſing conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual <hi>Halelujahs</hi> for ever: <hi>how will they run the wayes of Gods commandments,</hi> when all the clogs of corruption are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, and their feet are inlarged? Now their labour ſhall be turned into leiſure to praiſe him, when they have nothing elſe to do, yea nothing which they delight more to do, than that. Now 'tis death, and death alone that can put us into the poſſeſſion of this glory, where we ſhall have fulneſs of Joy and Glory, and be Heirs, yea Coheirs with Chriſt; and would
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:34727:181"/>any wiſe man deny to take poſſeſſion? Oh my ſoul, wilt thou yet hang back, and plead Nonage? art thou afraid of Eternity, when Joy and Happineſs is added to it? couldſt thou wiſh the worm of time were at the root, to make it wither? art thou come to the door, and thou makeſt a halt at the threſhold? and art willing another ſhould take thy Crown, and wouldſt thou ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render thy intereſt? when <hi>Paul</hi> looks through the Perſpective glaſs of Faith, and ſees happineſs at the end, he was willing to dye and be with Chriſt; thou knoweſt whom thou haſt believed, and dareſt not truſt thy Redeemer with thy life, that loſt his own for thy ſake? whatever thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt, whatever thou ſuffereſt for him, it will never repent thee when thou art in Heaven; it will reward thee for all thy coſt and charges, Chriſt tells thee, an <hi>hundred fold,</hi> and I may well ſay a <hi>thouſand;</hi> one day in Gods Courts here on earth was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Davîd than a thouſand elſewhere,</hi> and one day in Heaven is much better than that; yea, but if thy life be cut off for his ſake, for one day thou looſeſt upon earth, thou ſhalt have a thouſand in Heaven for it, he will make thee Eagle-eyed, that thou ſhalt behold the Sun of righteouſneſs in his ſplendour, and the Organ not offended.

Now the marriage ſhall be ſolemnized, that was ſo long ago contracted between Chriſt and the Soul; this is the day which the Lord hath made, let us rejoyce and be glad in it: this is thy pay-day, when thou art to receive thy wages, the harveſt of thy hopes; when thou ſhalt receive a plentiful crop of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; that which was ſown in tears, ſhall now be reaped with joy: now thy deſires, thy longings and thy pantings ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied; now is the time when the Crown of Martyrdom ſhall be put upon the head of the Martyr, and a Crown of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs upon the Juſt mans head: now is the time that Sincerity will be diſcerned from Hypocriſie, let it be ſpun with never ſo fine a thred, and true Gold from coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit: now is the time that thoſe that have Oyl in their Veſſels, as well as Lamps in their hands, ſhall go in with the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom

<note place="margin">Mat. 22.12</note> and he that hath none ſhall be caſt into <hi>utter darkneſs:</hi> now is the time that thoſe that have forſaken any thing for Chriſt, ſhall receive an hundred fold, and thoſe that have loſt their lives for him ſhall receive the greateſt ſhare, though thoſe that have the leaſt meaſure ſhal have <hi>Joy unſpeakable and full of glory,</hi> yea as much as they can hold; and who but a mad man notwithſtanding this, will look upon Religion as a Frenzy, and the profeſſors thereof little better than frantick, becauſe they run themſelves upon the pikes of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and expoſe themſelves to loſſes and croſſes, to troubles and trials, yea to death it ſelf, and that for conſcience ſake? but did theſe men ſee the prize they run for, the Crown they fight for, they would run the ſame race, and fight the ſame fight; if any of them were but offered an handful of Gold for a handful of Silver, they would not refuſe it, much leſs if they might have an handful of Angels for a handful of Muck; but believers make a better exchange, for they receive Heaven for the Earth, and God for the Creatures, yea eternal Life for that which is temporal: did others know the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, they would do the work; <hi>did they ſee
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:34727:182"/>the joy that is ſet before them, they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the croſs and deſpiſe the ſhame</hi> as well as they; but how can thoſe ſee that are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally blind, or know <hi>whoſe fooliſh hearts are darkned;</hi> they are at leaſt ſand blind, and cannot ſee at a diſtance, nor diſcern what it is that ſtands beyond death, and ſeeing no other pleaſure but what only reaches the ſenſes, take up with that, and think there is no better: did they ſee better, they would deſire better; thoſe that know no better than Hell, never look after Heaven: were they nearer to God that Spiritual Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, they would be drawn to him, they would then contemn theſe fading delights, and lay hold upon everlaſting happineſs; they would contemn this unrighteous Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and ſeek after True Treaſure: they ſee indeed both wayes, but cannot ſee to the end; the one they ſee broad and eaſie, green and pleaſant, but they ſee not the dangerous Precipice it leads to, and the fiery Gulph it ends in; they ſee the other alſo, which is rough and craggy, ſteep and hilly, which few men walk in, but they ſee not the Pleaſures it ends in, and therefore they chooſe the other, and think they do wiſely, and think they are Fools that do otherwiſe; but had they the Saints ſpectacles, they would change their minds:
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:34727:183"/>
                  <hi>but this their way is their folly,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ignorance can make them walk in it; the time will come they would change their courſe but cannot, as the fooliſh Virgins would have had Oyl when it was too late; corrupted Reaſon being inchanted by ſenſe proves a Caterer for the fleſh, but were it rectifyed by faith, it would look for happineſs elſewhere. There are too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny like a Cardinal I have read of, that uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſaid, <hi>I will not leave my part in</hi> Paris <hi>for a part in</hi> Paradiſe: they are wedded to the world, and are loth to be divorced. 'Tis true, believers know little of the nature of Heavens joyes, theſe know nothing of it; the former have ſome glimpſes of the glory, ſome foretaſtes of the ſweetneſs of <hi>Canaans</hi> fruits, this ſets them a longing; the other are ſtrangers to it; <hi>ignotus nulla cupido:</hi> The godly know not the quantity of it, for how can that be diſcovered that is unſpeakable, or conceived of, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable? or how can that be meaſured that is infinite? this we may build upon, 'tis <hi>our maſters Joy,</hi> and therefore great; it cannot enter into us, but we muſt enter into it: methinks when we ſpeak or hear of Joy unſpeakable, of Light inacceſſible, and of Glory immortal, our hearts may burn within us, like the Diſciples which
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:34727:183"/>were going to <hi>Emaus,</hi> when Chriſt ſpake to them; it ſhould make us caſt a deſpiſing eye upon all the worlds glory, and make us think no pains too much, nor coſt too dear, to come to the enjoyment of it; it might make us run that we may obtain, fight that we might conquer, and travel hard to come to our journeys end; for then all our work will be done, all our pains over, and we ſhall have nothing to do but to praiſe the Lord, which will be our wages as well as our work: for when we are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualized, and the droſs of corruption left behind, it will be as natural to us as to live, and as now it is to breathe; for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but our corruption now, that makes this Angelical duty troubleſome. And is there enough in Heaven to make amends for all our loſſes and croſſes upon earth? let us then never ſtick at the price, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we expend for Chriſt, or Heaven, it ſhall be paid back with advantage. If <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> Servants were ſo happy in ſeeing his glory, and hearing his wiſdom, Oh what a happineſs will it be to ſee his glory in Heaven when it will be increaſed, and hear his wiſdom when 'tis perfected! nay in enjoying <hi>Solomons</hi> God, and partaking both of his glory and wiſdom! and Oh the Honour that believers will have in ſuch
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:34727:184"/>a Relation, where they will have God for their Father, Chriſt for their Husband, the Angels and Saints for their Brethren and companions, and not only ſeed upon An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels food, but be ſet upon an Angelical Employment, and have the Angel reward! And if this be not enough to ſatisfie for all the pains, troubles, loſſes, and croſſes, thou ſuſtain upon this account, never take upon thee the profeſſion of Religion: but I am ſure there is puniſhment enough in hell for all thoſe that make light of Chriſt, and ſlight the offers of the Goſpel. Oh the purblind world, that can ſee nothing but what is under their feet! had they but ſuch a ſight of God and Glory as ſome others have had, they would deſire with <hi>Paul to be diſſolved,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 1.23.

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:34727:185"/>muſt needs be in the dark when we diſcourſe of God, the Father of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and the Creator of Angels: while we are in the fleſh we know little of the nature and Original of our own ſouls, how then can we ſpeak of thoſe glorious ſpirits, or know what their enjoyments in Heaven are? if we conſult with things below, and ſearch Natures Garden from end to end, we may find work enough to do; nay the leaſt of creatures hath ſomething in it to puzzle Natures beſt Secretaries: the <hi>Gnat,</hi> the <hi>Bee,</hi> thoſe poor Inſects are not without their wonders; and what then if we conſider Gods greateſt works, the Sun, Moon and Stars, and all the hoſt of Heaven; and if we underſtand not earthly things, about which we are daily converſant, how ſhall we underſtand heavenly things ſo far above our reach? if we underſtand not things viſible, and thoſe ſubjected to our ſenſes, what ſhall we ſay of inviſibles, ſo remote from us? <hi>If the footmen have wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried us, how ſhall we contend with horſes?</hi> If we cannot wade a ſmall Rivulet, what ſhall we do with the Ocean? what concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can a poor worm have of an Angel, or a rational ſoul? and proportionably muſt we have of the great God: what concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can a man born blind have of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,

Oh my God, I ſee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſufficient, why I ſhould give up my Life to thy diſpoſe; I am convinc'd that it is my Duty and my Intereſt. Lord ſuffer not this treacherous heart to deceive me, let me conſult with Faith and not with Sence; let me never truſt in my own ſtrength, neither diſtruſt thine: Lord, through thy ſtrength I can do all things, but without thee I can do nothing. Lord, I believe, help my unbelief; let me honour thee both by my life, and by my death: if thou wilt thou canſt let this Cup paſs from me, yet not my will but thine be done. Lord, fit the back before thou lay on the burden, enable me to obey, and then command what thou wilt: if it be thy will I ſhall be ſacrificed, Lord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Sacrifice, and thy will be done: let thy ſtrength be ſeen in my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Lord Jeſus receive my Spirit.</p>

            <l>THE Life we live reſembles much a Play,</l>
            <l>Where each man acts his part, and ſo away:</l>
            <l>The beſt act Comedies which Joyfully end,</l>
            <l>Moſt Tragedies, which to confuſion tend:</l>
            <l>Men are the Actors, and the World's the Stage,</l>
            <l>Whereon appears perſons of every age,</l>
            <l>The good, the bad, the noble and the baſe,</l>
            <l>Both Males and Females, even all <hi>Adams</hi> race.</l>
            <l>None are exempt, each have ſome part to play,</l>
            <l>Yet ſome have leſſer, ſome have more to ſay.</l>
            <l>Some Childrens parts do play, they cry and then</l>
            <l>March off, when others act the parts of Men.</l>
            <l>Some on the Stage do fetch a turn or two,</l>
            <l>Some look about them, and no more adoe:</l>
            <l>Some act their own, and ſome anothers part;</l>
            <l>In a diſguiſe they're honeſt, Knaves in heart.</l>
            <l>The worſt in Royal Robes ſometimes do dreſs them,</l>
            <l>Thoſe that their inſide view have cauſe to bleſs them;</l>
            <l>In their diſguiſe like painted Tombs they ſhine,</l>
            <l>They're fair without, but foul enough within.</l>
            <l>In Silks and Sattins many men are clad,</l>
            <l>When Dunghill-rakers are not half ſo bad;</l>
            <l>But when Death comes, in their own ſhape we find them,</l>
            <l>Their borrowed Robes they then muſt leave behind them.</l>
            <l>Some act in thred-bare Coats, yet you may find</l>
            <l>Under that ſordid Veſt a gallant Mind:</l>
            <l>Though theſe are ſcorned by our Gallants gay,</l>
            <l>Yet theſe do act their parts as well as they.</l>
            <l>Some act Religious parts, but moſt prophane;</l>
            <l>The Hypocrite, he is for either Game;</l>
            <l>For he hath Vizards, if he pleaſe, enow</l>
            <l>To make him ſeem <hi>prophane</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> too:</l>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:34727:191"/>
            <l>For he can one way look, and row another,</l>
            <l>In a diſguiſe he'l cozen his own Brother;</l>
            <l>Where Intereſt or the Devil drives he'l goe,</l>
            <l>And ſhifts his Sails ſtill as the wind doth blow:</l>
            <l>He'l act you any part, Noble or Baſe,</l>
            <l>With his Apparel he can change his Face;</l>
            <l>Each day like to the Moon, his Face is new,</l>
            <l>With the <hi>Chameleon</hi> he can change his hue,</l>
            <l>Ape-like he'l imitate whate're he ſee;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Proteus</hi> never had more ſhapes than he:</l>
            <l>Like <hi>Mercury</hi> with Good he'l ſeem the beſt;</l>
            <l>If found with Bad, he will exceed the reſt:</l>
            <l>Religion is his ſtalking-horſe, and he</l>
            <l>Doth only uſe it for to take his prey;</l>
            <l>So long as he can get by't he will uſe it,</l>
            <l>But if he loſe by't, he will ſoon refuſe it;</l>
            <l>Him of his borrowed Robes Death will diveſt,</l>
            <l>He'l dye in Earneſt, though he liv'd in Jeſt.</l>
            <l>Some more ingeniouſly ſhew what they are,</l>
            <l>Rotten they are at heart, and ſo appear:</l>
            <l>Taverns they haunt, their Names not States to raiſe,</l>
            <l>And thoſe in Hell do go for roaring Boyes.</l>
            <l>In <hi>Venus</hi> Courts ſome live, but moſt of theſe</l>
            <l>Come lamely off, or die of her diſeaſe:</l>
            <l>Some few ſtay Natures time, moſt run before,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Bacchus</hi> or <hi>Venus</hi> opens them the door.</l>
            <l>Some cheat, ſome ſteal, ſome lye, ſome ſwear and curſe,</l>
            <l>And moſt, though bad enough, grow worſe and worſe:</l>
            <l>But when their part is acted Death will come,</l>
            <l>And clear the Stage, and then the Play is done.</l>
            <l>Moſt are hiſs'd off the Stage, few get applauſe,</l>
            <l>For few of acting well obſerve the Laws:</l>
            <l>Some few to Wiſdoms Rules their hearts apply,</l>
            <l>And theſe know how to live, and how to dye.</l>
            <l>Some mind their buſineſs, moſt time idly ſpend;</l>
            <l>Some love their way, but few their Journeys end.</l>
            <l>For Riches, Honours, Pleaſures moſt men ſtrive,</l>
            <l>But to get wiſdom is the way to thrive.</l>
            <l>Some court fair Ladies, whoſe bewitching Spells</l>
            <l>Ruines the State, and ſinks the Souls to Hell.</l>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:34727:191"/>
            <l>Some few improve their time while God doth lend it,</l>
            <l>When others ſtudy vainly how to ſpend it:</l>
            <l>How for to live moſt men their thoughts apply,</l>
            <l>But wiſe is he that ſtudies how to dye.</l>
            <l>The heav'nly Loadſtone Grace having toucht the Soul,</l>
            <l>Makes her unſettled till ſhe finds the Pole.</l>
            <l>This World will not ſuffice for her abode;</l>
            <l>She's reſtleſs here, her Polar Starre is God.</l>
            <l>This Heaven-born Eagle mounts and ſoars too high,</l>
            <l>To feed on Carrion that in Ditches lye;</l>
            <l>This World ſhe hath conquer'd, and with <hi>Philips</hi> Son,</l>
            <l>She'd weep if there were not more worlds than one.</l>
            <l>This Pilgrim cares not where ſhe lays her head,</l>
            <l>She ſleeps ſecurely, if God make her bed.</l>
            <l>In a cold Priſon ſhe can lye and eaſe her,</l>
            <l>With <hi>Jacobs</hi> Viſions <hi>Jacobs</hi> Stone will pleaſe her.</l>
            <l>Moſt men 'tis true, complain of grief and trouble,</l>
            <l>But few of ſin, which makes their ſorrows double:</l>
            <l>Troubles ariſe from ſin, the World and Devil,</l>
            <l>God makes our dayes ſo few, we make them evil.</l>
            <l>The world much like an Inne ſerves for a day,</l>
            <l>Some only break their faſt, and ſo away:</l>
            <l>Some dine, ſome ſup, and ſome are richly treated,</l>
            <l>But thoſe that eat moſt Meals are moſt indebted.</l>
            <l>If any ſuffer hardſhip, 'tis the beſt:</l>
            <l>The worſe the man, the better is the Gueſt:</l>
            <l>Some feaſt, ſome drink, ſome game, ſome drab and whore,</l>
            <l>But when they come to pay, their reck'ning's more.</l>
            <l>The World's to bad men as the Earth to weeds,</l>
            <l>She'l cheriſh thoſe, but choak the better ſeeds;</l>
            <l>And Stepdame-like, ſhe will Gods children ſerve,</l>
            <l>She'l feed her own, but ſuffer them to ſterve,</l>
            <l>For entertainment ſhe's much like to <hi>Jael,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>She offers Milk, when ſhe intends the Nail;</l>
            <l>Who truſteth to her ſmiles, doth quite miſtake her,</l>
            <l>The wiſeſt men they be that quite forſake her.</l>
            <l>Well, though the way be rough, let's mend our pace.</l>
            <l>Our Journey's ſhort, and then we ſhall have eaſe.</l>
            <l>Life's but a ſhadow which is alwayes flying,</l>
            <l>For from the Cradle we are alwayes dying;</l>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:34727:192"/>
            <l>'Tis but an Hour-glaſs, and the ſands are ſins,</l>
            <l>Brimm'd up by Nature, turn'd when Life begins.</l>
            <l>Which ſtill is running, as each day doth come,</l>
            <l>And when the laſt fins dropt, our life is done.</l>
            <l>Our labour's near an end, our death is haſting,</l>
            <l>And good or bad rewards are everlaſting.</l>
            <l>We reach not <hi>Neſtors</hi> dayes with our ſhort ſpan,</l>
            <l>Nor number years with old <hi>Methuſalem.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Men lived then five hundred years or more,</l>
            <l>Not one of twenty now can reach Threeſcore:</l>
            <l>No, no, our Meaſure's cut, it well appears,</l>
            <l>Our Fathers Months were longer than our Years.</l>
            <l>The Hart, the Stagg, the Raven, the Eagle free,</l>

            <l>Life's like a Bubble that's ſoon prickt by Death,</l>
            <l>For Man is but a Bladder fill'd with Breath.</l>
            <l>Life haſteth like a Ship that's under Sails,</l>
            <l>Death cometh like the Tide that never fails.</l>
            <l>Our Time like Lightning full quick doth goe;</l>
            <l>Death haſtneth like an Arrow from a Bowe:</l>
            <l>Such is the Life of Man, for in a day</l>
            <l>Man ſprings and withers, like a Flower in <hi>May;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The Sun ne're runs his race in this our age</l>
            <l>But ſees ten thouſand marching off the Stage:</l>
            <l>The Life we live is but an inch of time;</l>
            <l>Laſt day my Fathers was, and this day mine:</l>
            <l>The next belongs to the ſucceeding age;</l>
            <l>Thus one doth thruſt another off the Stage.</l>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:34727:192"/>
            <l>My Predeceſſors they are dead and rotten,</l>
            <l>And I in little time ſhall be forgotten.</l>
            <l>Great <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Bones Death did to Aſhes turn,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Alexander</hi>'s bounded in his Urn.</l>
            <l>The fair, the foul, the Holy, the Prophane,</l>
            <l>The Rich, the Poor, are worſted at Death's Game.</l>
            <l>To Mighty <hi>Sampſon</hi> Death did give a Fall,</l>
            <l>Wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> did dye, and ſo muſt all.</l>
            <l>Though in thy hand all <hi>Peru</hi>'s Gold thou have,</l>
            <l>Death will thee make a Tenant to the Grave:</l>
            <l>Death makes no difference between Poor and Rich,</l>
            <l>The Worm feeds ſweetly on no matter which;</l>
            <l>The Faireſt Lady, and the fouleſt Slave</l>
            <l>Death can both wed and bed in the ſame Grave.</l>
            <l>To God a thouſand years is but a day,</l>
            <l>Our life's then but an Hour that fleets away.</l>
            <l>And of this Hour ſo many ſharers be,</l>
            <l>O Lord how ſmall a part belongs to thee?</l>
            <l>Though life ſeems long becauſe 'tis full of trouble,</l>
            <l>Yet many wiſh their dayes were three times double.</l>
            <l>The Captive Slaves that in the Gallies lye,</l>
            <l>To end their Bondage, yet are loth to dye;</l>
            <l>They flee from death although he be their friend,</l>
            <l>For when he ſtops their Breath their Sorrows end.</l>
            <l>Life is a warfare, Death doth ſtint the ſtrife;</l>
            <l>We leave not fighting till we leave our life.</l>
            <l>We fight againſt our ſins, the world and Devils,</l>
            <l>At death we fully Vanquiſh all thoſe evils.</l>
            <l>To heavenly Joyes Death opens us the door,</l>
            <l>Where ſin and ſorrow they ſhall be no more:</l>
            <l>There's no Corruption ſhall moleſt us there,</l>
            <l>There's no Temptation that we need to fear.</l>
            <l>Why fear we Death then, he this Boon will give,</l>
            <l>Our Enemies ſhall dye, but we ſhall live?</l>
            <l>Life is the day wherein we labour hard,</l>
            <l>Death is the night, and then comes our reward.</l>
            <l>Now we with Tempeſts on the Seas are driven,</l>
            <l>Death is the Wind that blows us to our Haven.</l>
            <l>Is he leſs happy that a brisker Gale</l>
            <l>Drives to the Shore, or he that's under Sail?</l>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:34727:193"/>
            <l>Whom fierce tempeſtuous winds as yet are driving,</l>
            <l>Who with a thouſand dangers yet are ſtriving?</l>
            <l>In life we in the raging Surges be,</l>
            <l>Death comes and lands us in Eternity.</l>
            <l>In life the Saints are Heirs but under age,</l>
            <l>When death comes they receive their Heritage:</l>
            <l>Heaven is our Kingdom, but to come thereat,</l>
            <l>There is no other way but through this Gate.</l>
            <l>Life is our Journey, Death our Journeys end,</l>
            <l>Life is our Enemy and Death our Friend.</l>
            <l>Death like a Pilot guides us to the Shoar,</l>
            <l>He is the Porter that muſt ope' the door.</l>
            <l>We cannot ſerve our God or Chriſt enjoy,</l>
            <l>Without diſtraction till our dying day.</l>
            <l>Death's but a quiet ſleep when wearied,</l>
            <l>'Tis but put off our Cloaths, and go to bed.</l>
            <l>Death is Gods purſivant and will compell</l>
            <l>Gods Friends to go to Heaven, his Foes to Hell.</l>
            <l>He is his Meſſenger none can prevent him,</l>
            <l>None can reſiſt him, or the Lord that ſent him.</l>
            <l>Both Prince and Peaſant drink of the ſame cup,</l>
            <l>When he invites them home with him to Sup.</l>
            <l>All men muſt pledge the health <hi>Abel</hi> began,</l>
            <l>There's none exempt, the Maſter nor the man.</l>
            <l>The greateſt Potentate cannot eſcape,</l>
            <l>The way to Heaven and Hell lye through this Gate:</l>
            <l>The high, the low, the rich, and eke the poor,</l>
            <l>When he doth knock muſt open him the door;</l>
            <l>Nor fear nor favour makes him turn aſide,</l>
            <l>He will not be perverted with a Bribe.</l>
            <l>What though ſome have their lives drawn out at length,</l>
            <l>And we cut down by Death in our full ſtrength?</l>
            <l>What Hurt to us if we receive our pay</l>
            <l>For one Hours work, as much as for a day?</l>
            <l>What dammage to us if Commandment come,</l>
            <l>When others work till night, to leave at Noon?</l>
            <l>The weary labourer pants and longs for reſt,</l>
            <l>And when he's in his bed he thinks he's beſt;</l>
            <l>The Bed of Death to th' weary will give eaſe,</l>
            <l>Our ſleep's not broken there by worms nor fleas:</l>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:34727:193"/>
            <l>No fearfull Dreams, nor Viſions of the night</l>
            <l>Diſturb our Fancies there, or minds affright.</l>
            <l>Within Death's Sheets the Grave we reſt ſecure,</l>
            <l>Free from oppreſſion, and tyrannick Power;</l>
            <l>Our Souls like Captive Birds in Cages ſing,</l>
            <l>Death breaks the Cage, and then the Birds take wing.</l>
            <l>The world's a Peſt-houſe, ſin doth us infect,</l>
            <l>Death's our Phyſitian, ſhall we him reject?</l>
            <l>The Soul's infected with ſins foul diſeaſe,</l>
            <l>And naught but Death can give us our releaſe.</l>
            <l>The world's a Priſon and we Captives be,</l>
            <l>And only Death our Champion ſets us free.</l>
            <l>We mortal are when Death of life bereaves us.</l>
            <l>We dye no more, Death doth immortal leave us.</l>
            <l>A thouſand Maladies do each day attend us,</l>
            <l>We're ſick to Death and none but Death can mend us.</l>
            <l>In life we languiſh, Death can make us well,</l>
            <l>He's like <hi>Achilles</hi> Spear, can wound and heal.</l>
            <l>Poor and in want we up and down do wander,</l>
            <l>Death makes us all as rich as <hi>Alexander.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Death levels all, both rich and poor do ſtand</l>
            <l>On equal ground, none ſerve nor none command.</l>
            <l>When Death hath done his work, there's no man can</l>
            <l>Diſcern between the Maſter and the man.</l>
            <l>The Princes Skull no more than other men</l>
            <l>Bears the impreſſion of a Diadem.</l>
            <l>'Tis true of terrors Death is call'd the King,</l>
            <l>And well he may while he retains his Sting;</l>
            <l>But to Believers he no hurt can do,</l>
            <l>For he hath loſt his Sting and Poyſon too.</l>
            <l>In Stinging Chriſt this Serpent loſt his Sting,</l>
            <l>He that brought terror then doth comfort bring:</l>
            <l>Chriſt conquer'd him, and ſhall we fear to meet</l>
            <l>A Vanquiſht Foe, lying proſtrate at our Feet?</l>
            <l>For ſince that he was overcome and foil'd,</l>
            <l>He is no Enemy, but reconcil'd.</l>
            <l>To good and bad he ſhews not the ſame face,</l>
            <l>He's Foe to Nature; but a Friend to Grace.</l>
            <l>We are poor mortals, life is our diſeaſe,</l>
            <l>Death our Phyſitian that can give us eaſe.</l>

            <l>We groan for pain, yet would not be ſet free,</l>

            <l>Rather than over <hi>Jordans</hi> ſtreams we'l venture,</l>
            <l>We'l dye i'th' Wilderneſs, or <hi>Egypt</hi> enter:</l>
            <l>This Son of <hi>Anak</hi> Death more terror brings</l>
            <l>Than all the fiery Serpents with their Stings.</l>
            <l>And though <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage doth torment us,</l>
            <l>Fleſh Pots, and Leeks, and Onions here content us</l>
            <l>At Death 'tis true, we muſt to Aſhes turn,</l>

            <l>And when the all-awakening trump ſhall ſound,</l>
            <l>The ſmalleſt Atoms of it ſhall be found;</l>
            <l>And then by vertue of a new Indenture,</l>
